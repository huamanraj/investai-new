This \nprinciple is reflected in the relationships we share with \nour partners, customers, and communities. \nAs we enter the next phase of our journey, our focus will \nbe on scaling responsibly, deepening our technological \nedge, and expanding our presence in pharmaceuticals, \nagrochemicals, material sciences, and emerging \ndustries. With the continued trust of our stakeholders, \nwe will shape Aether into a global leader that reflects \nwhat we stand for today and the ambitions we hold for \ntomorrow. \n“The ultimate measure of Aether’s success will be the \nd enduring value we build, the trust we uphold, and the \nmark we leave on industries and communities for \ndecades to come.” \nI extend my heartfelt appreciation to our employees, \nshareholders, customers, bankers, partners, government \nagencies, and the communities we serve. Your trust, \nedication, and collaboration remain the foundation of \nour progress. Together, we will continue to advance \nAether’s vision, capture new opportunities, and shape a \nfuture that reflects our highest aspirations. \nAshwin Desai \nFounding Promoter | Managing Director\n“Our journey is \ndriven by a simple \nbelief — if we can \nimagine it, we can \ncreate it and if we \ncreate it, we can \nscale it”\nincreasing utilisation, and Site 4 has been \nsuccessfully commercialised with scale-up \ninitiatives underway. \nOur Greenfield projects, Site 3++ and Site 5, are \nadvancing rapidly. Site 5 is being developed as a \nworld-class facility that reflects our commitment to \nmanufacturing excellence, and the acquisition of an \nadditional 15 acres adjacent to it ensures room for \nfuture growth. \nSafety and human capital remain at the heart of our \noperations. We have strengthened training, invested \nin advanced monitoring systems, and embedded \nsafety reviews across all stages from R&D to \nmanufacturing. These measures are part of a \nculture where every Aetherian is valued, protected, \nand empowered. \nThis year, we also introduced a company-wide \nuniform system that reflects professionalism while \nretaining creativity. Every employee now has a well￾designed uniform that blends comfort with identity. \nFor our manufacturing teams, we provide T-shirts \npaired with cargo trousers, incorporating subtle \nradium elements that gently shine at night. This \nfeature ensures safety and easy identification, while \nalso adding a touch of uniqueness to daily wear.

The past year \nhas been a period of renewed strength and purposeful \nprogress. We have navigated a complex business \nenvironment with agility, strengthened our \nfundations, and advanced our vision of building \nAether into a trusted global leader in specialty \nchemicals. I extend my heartfelt thanks to our \nshareholders for their unwavering belief in our journey, \nto our employees for their dedication, and to every \nstakeholder who has supported us along the way. \n“Aether pioneers new frontiers in science and \nindustry, distinguished by the ability to turn \ncomplexity into clarity, challenges into \nopportunities, and ideas into lasting impact.” \nChanging trade dynamics, structural shifts and \ngeopolitical uncertainties continue to evolve the \nglobal economy. While these trends have challenged \nmany economies, India’s economy has maintained its \ngrowth momentum with strong domestic demand, \ntargeted reforms, and rising investment flows. This \nfavourable climate, coupled with an increasing focus \non technology, sustainability, and self-reliance, \npositions our country as a vital centre for \nmanufacturing and innovation. \nAt Aether, we are determined to harness this moment. \nOur core purpose — to combine advanced chemistry \nwith technology-driven manufacturing — guides every \ninvestment we make. We continue to expand our R&D \nand pilot plant capabilities, enabling us to translate \nideas into scalable solutions with speed and precision. \nThis capability, coupled with our deep customer \npartnerships, strengthens our position as the preferred \npartner for industries seeking complex and \ndifferentiated solutions. \nManufacturing remains central to our progress. Site 1 is \nactively engaged in strategic global projects. Site 2 \nhas returned to full operational momentum with \nenhanced systems and controls.

      "text": "About Aether\nAether Industries Limited, headquartered in Surat, Gujarat, is more than just a specialty chemicals company — it is a \nstory of ambition, precision, and breakthrough innovation. We create advanced intermediates and specialty \nchemicals for critical sectors, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, material sciences, coatings, high￾performance photography, additives, and oil & gas. \nOur journey began in 2013 with a vision to redefine India’s place in the global chemical landscape. The early years \nfocused on building foundations — assembling exceptional talent, creating state-of-the-art facilities, and investing \ndeeply in research and development. By 2018, commercial operations were in full swing, and since then, we have \nsustained a compound annual growth rate of nearly 35%, establishing Aether as one of India’s \nfastest-growing specialty chemical enterprises. \nOur business model is anchored on three pillars — Contract Research and Manufacturing Services \n(CRAMS), Contract and Exclusive Manufacturing (CEM), and Large-Scale Exclusive Manufacturing \n(LEM). Initially, the pharmaceutical sector was our primary revenue driver. \nWe have since diversified into other high-value sectors such as oil & gas, material sciences, and \nspecialty performance chemicals. Today, CRAMS is the most significant focus of our business model, \reflecting our ability to deliver complex, \nhigh-impact projects for growing global clientele.\nThe in-house R&D sets us apart. Each chemistry \nand technology we deploy has been conceived, \ndeveloped, and perfected by our own research \nteam.\nFrom a small team in 2013 to a recognised global \ncontender in 2025, Aether’s story remains one of resilience, innovation, and a clear vision — to lead, \nto pioneer, and to keep challenging what’s \npossible.\nWe scale these innovations in our advanced and world’s largest Pilot Plant and bring them to full-scale production \nthrough processes we design and engineer ourselves. \nWe have created products never made in India before and compete with well-established Chinese companies, \nbreaking new ground along the way. This bold spirit was recognised in 2022 with our successful IPO, and again in \n2023 with a landmark QIP. These milestones reflect the trust our investors place in our innovative chemistries, robust \nsystems, and the relentless drive of our people. \nOur team, the “Aetherians,” is young, dynamic, enthusiastic, and determined. With an average age of just 29 years, \nwe are powered by fresh perspectives and united by a shared commitment to excellence. Together, we have built a \ncompany that doesn’t just follow global standards — we set them.\nToday, Aether is expanding its operational footprint and leading India’s march into \nadvanced specialty chemicals with sustainability at its core. From commissioning solar \npower projects to forging global partnerships in plastic upscaling and bio-based \nproducts, we are shaping a future where cutting-edge chemistry works hand in hand with \nenvironmental responsibility.\n7 About Aether\n[IMAGE FOR PAGE: 5 / 5]"
