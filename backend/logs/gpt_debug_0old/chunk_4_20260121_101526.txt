    "Financial Growth\nConsistent Performance, Promising Future\nOver the period from FY2016-17 to FY2024-25 Aether Industries has moved from a small, single-site specialty chemicals manufacturer to a diversified, scale-capable specialty chemicals and CRAMS player — delivering exceptional top-line growth, sustained operating margins, expanding manufacturing footprint and improved absolute profitability. This transition has been driven by capacity commissioning, a broadened product mix (specialty chemicals, contract manufacturing and CRAMS), selective inorganic/organic capacity investment and an IPO that accelerated the Company’s institutional profile and access to capital.\n1. Revenue growth — scale and compounding expansion\nAether’s revenue has grown very rapidly in absolute terms over the years. The Company reported total revenues in the early commissioning year of FY2016-17 of ₹248.60 million (≈ ₹24.86 crore), reflecting the first commercial streams coming online, and reported total income for FY2024-25 of ₹880.33 crore, representing a transformational increase in scale. When measured on a consistent basis (FY2016-17 → FY2024-25), this implies a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~56% in revenue — a rare rate of compounding that illustrates both strong market demand and the successful execution of capacity ramps and commercial traction.\n2. Profitability and margins — healthy operating leverage\nAether has historically delivered robust operating margins for a chemicals manufacturer. In FY2018-19 and FY2019-20 the Company reported EBITDA margins in the mid-20% range (the FY2018-19 EBIDTA margin was ~24.4%; FY2019-20 ~24.3%), demonstrating a high-margin product mix early in its growth. In FY2024-25, the business maintained healthy profitability with improved absolute EBITDA and a return to positive full-year PAT after earlier volatility. The FY2024-25 consolidated financials show a notable recovery in PAT and EBITDA as revenues scaled.\n3. Profitability trajectory (absolute profits)\nAbsolute PAT has shown volatility historically—early years had modest profits as the company invested to scale, and certain years included non-recurring items and exceptional events. Importantly, FY2024-25 recorded a meaningful recovery in annual total income and reported consolidated profits for the year (and the Q4 FY25 quarter reported net profit and revenue growth quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year). For FY2024-25 total income was ₹880.33 crore and the company reported positive consolidated PAT for the year.\n4. Segmental performance and business mix\nAether operates principally across three revenue pools:\n1. Speciality chemicals (large-scale proprietary intermediates) — primary revenue contributor, benefits from technical know-how and scale.\n2. Contract / Exclusive Manufacturing — manufacturing for large pharma/chemical customers on long-term and multi-year relationships.\n3. CRAMS (Contract Research & Manufacturing Services) — higher-value R&D-linked manufacturing with escalating demand, particularly after the Company’s public listing and focused business development.\nThe relative weighting shifted over the period in favour of CRAMS and contract manufacturing, increasing recurring revenue visibility and improving absolute EBITDA contribution per rupee of revenue. The Company’s investor materials and presentations emphasise an expanding share of CRAMS in the mix.\n5. Capital investment, capacity and strategic initiatives\nGrowth has been capital-intensive and deliberate:\n1. Multiple capacity commissioning phases since 2016 (new process streams in 2016, further expansions across FY2017–FY2021).\n2. Solar captive generation (announced and commissioned in stages) to improve energy security and reduce operating cost intensity.\n3. Public listing in mid-2022 provided access to a wider capital base and supported both organic expansion and working-capital needs.\n4. Expansion of Manufacturing Facility 3 in FY 2019-20 to 2020-21, Manufacturing Facility 4 in FY 2023-24, the beginning of expansion of Manufacturing Facility 3++ and Manufacturing Facility 5 (first phase) in FY2023-24 and FY2024-25.\n6. Financial position and balance-sheet strength\nThe Company’s balance sheet expanded to support larger working capital and fixed assets as capacity came online. Published balance-sheet extracts and independent analyst summaries show material increases in tangible assets and capital work-in-progress between FY2018 and FY2024 as new plants were capitalised. Ratings agencies and analysts have noted reasonable leverage given the growth profile and generally stable operating cash generation in recent reporting periods.\n7. Outlook and management focus (forward-looking)\nManagement’s communicated priorities for the coming 12–24 months can be summarised as:\n1. Complete the ramp-up of recently commissioned lines and convert order book into sustained revenue;\n2. Continue to grow CRAMS and contract manufacturing share to deepen recurring, long-tenor revenues;\n3. Maintain margin discipline while pursuing selective capacity additions;\n4. Strengthen HSE, ESG and risk controls following the FY2023 incident, and continue to scale captive renewable energy to reduce cost and scope-1/2 footprint.\nFrom the early commissioning revenue base in FY2016-17 to the considerably scaled operations of FY2024-25, Aether Industries’ financial journey reflects deliberate capacity building, a move up the value chain towards CRAMS and contract manufacturing, and disciplined operating execution that preserved strong operating margins through rapid growth. While episodic operational and market risks remain, the Company’s financial scale, improving absolute profitability and clarified strategic priorities position it to pursue the next phase of profitable growth.\nEarnings Growth\n33 Earnings Growth ₹ in MM\nThis has also helped us bring up positive operating cash flows in the Fiscal Year 2025, which were negative till the last fiscal year. Our approach continues to prioritise capital efficiency, risk management, and a strong balance sheet. With operational headroom, healthy liquidity, and robust governance, we are confident of sustaining growth while creating enduring value for all stakeholders.\nI would like to thank our investors, lenders, customers, and colleagues for their trust and support in another year of progress.”\nFaiz Nagariya \nChief Financial Officer",
