    "A Commitment beyond Business\n\nAs I reflect on the year gone by, I do so not merely as a director but as someone entrusted with a responsibility to ensure that Aether’s growth always comes forward its values, the vision, and its deeper purpose. This year has not just been a milestone. It has been a mirror, reflecting what we truly stand for, and a marker, showing where we are heading. Aether’s progress has always been deeply connected to the progress of the communities around us. We have never treated CSR as a checklist. It is a commitment that stems from gratitude. Our social responsibility is not shaped by regulation but by belief that growth, to be meaningful, must be shared. If there is one foundation on which our CSR vision firmly rests, it is education. Nearly 80 percent of our CSR contribution this year was dedicated to educational empowerment. We believe that education is not just a tool for betterment, It is the root of transformation. It changes individuals, strengthens families, and ultimately reshapes society. Especially in underserved and tribal areas, education has the power to shift generations forward. At Aether, we do not just support education. We invest in futures with depth, consistency, and care.\n\n“We grow \nwhen the \ncommunities \ngrow. We \nprogress when \nthe people \naround us rise.”\n\nOur vision is not limited to literacy. We support the full ecosystem — from school infrastructure to essential resources that ensure continuity in learning. Alongside this, we contributed to initiatives in healthcare, senior citizen care, animal welfare, and sports — areas that reflect our belief in inclusive and compassionate development.\n\nHealthcare remained a key focus for us this year, receiving over 12 percent of our total CSR contribution. But beyond numbers, what defines our healthcare efforts is intention. We focused on ensuring access to essential and preventive care for the most vulnerable because no one should be denied well-being due to where they are born or what they can afford. Health is not a privilege. It is a right. And as we move forward, we see healthcare not just as a support pillar, but as a space for meaningful service and real-world change.\n\nWe also supported Sports initiatives that cultivate focus, ambition, and national pride. These contributions, while part of a broader commitment, reflect our recognition of the role sports play in character building and community inspiration.\n\nWhat binds all our initiatives together is not a budget, but a belief that every act of responsibility carries the power to uplift lives. At Aether, we do not believe in charity. We believe in shared destiny.\n\n“We are proud that our values are not driven by circumstances but guided by conscience. “\n\nOur values are inspired by nature itself, by the five elements that have long guided Indian thought: earth, water, fire, air, and aether. From earth, we learn grounding, the need to stay rooted in purpose. Water teaches us adaptability, flowing to where the need is greatest. Fire gives us intensity, the will to act with clarity. Air teaches movement, the importance of growth with lightness and openness. And aether, the invisible fifth, reminds us of connection, spirit, and the space we must always leave for others to rise.\n\nThese five forces shape not just our CSR philosophy but our larger identity as an organisation. In every initiative we take, we ask ourselves if we are grounded like the earth, responsive like water, purposeful like fire, expansive like air, and inclusive like the aether.\n\n“Our purpose is not tied to markets. It is rooted in meaning. ”\n\nEven in times of uncertainty, our purpose has never wavered. We continue to act not because we have to, but because we deeply believe it matters. At Aether, we do not chase legacy. We build it patiently and quietly through decisions that uplift others and actions that outlive us.\n\nI extend my heartfelt gratitude to our employees, partners, and all stakeholders who walk this journey with us. Your commitment and belief are the silent strength behind every visible success.\n\nAs we look ahead, we remain rooted in values and committed to action. In 2025–26, we aim to expand our efforts toward environmental stewardship through initiatives that restore balance between growth and the natural world.\n\nWe believe the future will not be shaped by ambition alone, but by wisdom, responsibility, and the quiet strength to do what is right — even when no one is watching.\n\nPurnima Desai\nCo-Founder | Director (Finance & Accounts)\n\nA Commitment beyond Business",
