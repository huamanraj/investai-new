    "It is with deep pride and gratitude, we present the Annual Report for the Fiscal Year 2025. The past year has been a period of renewed strength and purposeful progress. We have navigated a complex business environment with agility, strengthened our foundations, and advanced our vision of building Aether into a trusted global leader in specialty chemicals. I extend my heartfelt thanks to our shareholders for their unwavering belief in our journey, to our employees for their dedication, and to every stakeholder who has supported us along the way.\n\n“Aether pioneers new frontiers in science and industry, distinguished by the ability to turn complexity into clarity, challenges into opportunities, and ideas into lasting impact.”\n\nChanging trade dynamics, structural shifts and geopolitical uncertainties continue to evolve the global economy. While these trends have challenged many economies, India’s economy has maintained its growth momentum with strong domestic demand, targeted reforms, and rising investment flows. This favourable climate, coupled with an increasing focus on technology, sustainability, and self-reliance, positions our country as a vital centre for manufacturing and innovation.\n\nAt Aether, we are determined to harness this moment. Our core purpose — to combine advanced chemistry with technology-driven manufacturing — guides every investment we make. We continue to expand our R&D and pilot plant capabilities, enabling us to translate ideas into scalable solutions with speed and precision. This capability, coupled with our deep customer partnerships, strengthens our position as the preferred partner for industries seeking complex and differentiated solutions.\n\nManufacturing remains central to our progress. Site 1 is actively engaged in strategic global projects. Site 2 has returned to full operational momentum with enhanced systems and controls. Site 3 is steadily advancing.",
    "Site 4 has been successfully commercialised with scale-up initiatives underway. Our Greenfield projects, Site 3++ and Site 5, are advancing rapidly. Site 5 is being developed as a world-class facility that reflects our commitment to manufacturing excellence, and the acquisition of an additional 15 acres adjacent to it ensures room for future growth. Safety and human capital remain at the heart of our operations. We have strengthened training, invested in advanced monitoring systems, and embedded safety reviews across all stages from R&D to manufacturing. These measures are part of a culture where every Aetherian is valued, protected, and empowered. This year, we also introduced a company-wide uniform system that reflects professionalism while retaining creativity. Every employee now has a well-designed uniform that blends comfort with identity. For our manufacturing teams, we provide T-shirts paired with cargo trousers, incorporating subtle radium elements that gently shine at night. This feature ensures safety and easy identification, while also adding a touch of uniqueness to daily wear. By combining functionality with design, we ensure our people feel pride in what they wear, without the monotony of a standard uniform. Alongside these initiatives, we have expanded professional development opportunities, welfare programs, and career growth pathways to ensure that our people grow with the company. We believe in doing what is right, even when it requires greater effort, and in building trust that endures. This principle is reflected in the relationships we share with our partners, customers, and communities. As we enter the next phase of our journey, our focus will be on scaling responsibly, deepening our technological edge, and expanding our presence in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, material sciences, and emerging industries. With the continued trust of our stakeholders, we will shape Aether into a global leader that reflects what we stand for today and the ambitions we hold for tomorrow.",
    "About Aether\nAether Industries Limited, headquartered in Surat, Gujarat, is more than just a specialty chemicals company — it is a story of ambition, precision, and breakthrough innovation. We create advanced intermediates and specialty chemicals for critical sectors, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, material sciences, coatings, high-performance photography, additives, and oil & gas. Our journey began in 2013 with a vision to redefine India’s place in the global chemical landscape. The early years focused on building foundations — assembling exceptional talent, creating state-of-the-art facilities, and investing deeply in research and development. By 2018, commercial operations were in full swing, and since then, we have sustained a compound annual growth rate of nearly 35%, establishing Aether as one of India’s fastest-growing specialty chemical enterprises.\n\nOur business model is anchored on three pillars — Contract Research and Manufacturing Services (CRAMS), Contract and Exclusive Manufacturing (CEM), and Large-Scale Exclusive Manufacturing (LEM). Initially, the pharmaceutical sector was our primary revenue driver. We have since diversified into other high-value sectors such as oil & gas, material sciences, and specialty performance chemicals. Today, CRAMS is the most significant focus of our business model, reflecting our ability to deliver complex, high-impact projects for growing global clientele.\n\nThe in-house R&D sets us apart. Each chemistry and technology we deploy has been conceived, developed, and perfected by our own research team.\n\nFrom a small team in 2013 to a recognised global contender in 2025, Aether’s story remains one of resilience, innovation, and a clear vision — to lead, to pioneer, and to keep challenging what’s possible.\n\nWe scale these innovations in our advanced and world’s largest Pilot Plant and bring them to full-scale production through processes we design and engineer ourselves. We have created products never made in India before and compete with well-established Chinese companies, breaking new ground along the way. This bold spirit was recognised in 2022 with our successful IPO, and again in 2023 with a landmark QIP. These milestones reflect the trust our investors place in our innovative chemistries, robust systems, and the relentless drive of our people.\n\nOur team, the “Aetherians,” is young, dynamic, enthusiastic, and determined. With an average age of just 29 years, we are powered by fresh perspectives and united by a shared commitment to excellence. Together, we have built a company that doesn’t just follow global standards — we set them.\n\nToday, Aether is expanding its operational footprint and leading India’s march into advanced specialty chemicals with sustainability at its core. From commissioning solar power projects to forging global partnerships in plastic upscaling and bio-based products, we are shaping a future where cutting-edge chemistry works hand in hand with environmental responsibility. \n\n7 About Aether"
