A Year of Strength and Progress
It is with deep pride and gratitude, we present the Annual Report for the Fiscal Year 2025. The past year has been a period of renewed strength and purposeful progress. We have navigated a complex business environment with agility, strengthened our foundations, and advanced our vision of building Aether into a trusted global leader in specialty chemicals. I extend my heartfelt thanks to our shareholders for their unwavering belief in our journey, to our employees for their dedication, and to every stakeholder who has supported us along the way.

“Our journey is driven by a simple belief — if we can imagine it, we can create it and if we create it, we can scale it”

“Uniforms at Aether are not mere attire — they are a shared identity, a commitment to safety, and a daily reminder that we move forward together.”

Alongside these initiatives, we have expanded professional development opportunities, welfare programs, and career growth pathways to ensure that our people grow with the company. We believe in doing what is right, even when it requires greater effort, and in building trust that endures. This principle is reflected in the relationships we share with our partners, customers, and communities.

Aether pioneers new frontiers in science and industry, distinguished by the ability to turn complexity into clarity, challenges into opportunities, and ideas into lasting impact. Changing trade dynamics, structural shifts and geopolitical uncertainties continue to evolve the global economy. While these trends have challenged many economies, India’s economy has maintained its growth momentum with strong domestic demand, targeted reforms, and rising investment flows. This favourable climate, coupled with an increasing focus on technology, sustainability, and self-reliance, positions our country as a vital centre for manufacturing and innovation.

At Aether, we are determined to harness this moment. Our core purpose — to combine advanced chemistry with technology-driven manufacturing — guides every investment we make. We continue to expand our R&#x26;D and pilot plant capabilities, enabling us to translate ideas into scalable solutions with speed and precision. This capability, coupled with our deep customer partnerships, strengthens our position as the preferred partner for industries seeking complex and differentiated solutions.

Manufacturing remains central to our progress. Site 1 is actively engaged in strategic global projects. Site 2 has returned to full operational momentum with enhanced systems and controls. Site 3 is steadily increasing utilisation, and Site 4 has been successfully commercialised with scale-up initiatives underway. Our Greenfield projects, Site 3++ and Site 5, are advancing rapidly. Site 5 is being developed as a world-class facility that reflects our commitment to manufacturing excellence, and the acquisition of an additional 15 acres adjacent to it ensures room for future growth.

As we enter the next phase of our journey, our focus will be on scaling responsibly, deepening our technological edge, and expanding our presence in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, material sciences, and emerging industries. With the continued trust of our stakeholders, we will shape Aether into a global leader that reflects what we stand for today and the ambitions we hold for tomorrow.

“The ultimate measure of Aether’s success will be the enduring value we build, the trust we uphold, and the mark we leave on industries and communities for decades to come.”

I extend my heartfelt appreciation to our employees, shareholders, customers, bankers, partners, government agencies, and the communities we serve. Your trust, dedication, and collaboration remain the foundation of our progress. Together, we will continue to advance Aether’s vision, capture new opportunities, and shape a future that reflects our highest aspirations.

About Aether

Aether Industries Limited, headquartered in Surat, Gujarat, is more than just a specialty chemicals company — it is a story of ambition, precision, and breakthrough innovation. We create advanced intermediates and specialty chemicals for critical sectors, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, material sciences, coatings, high-performance photography, additives, and oil &#x26; gas. We scale these innovations in our advanced and world’s largest Pilot Plant and bring them to full-scale production through processes we design and engineer ourselves.

We have created products never made in India before and compete with well-established Chinese companies, breaking new ground along the way. This bold spirit was recognised in 2022 with our successful IPO, and again in 2023 with a landmark QIP. These milestones reflect the trust our investors place in our innovative chemistries, robust systems, and the relentless drive of our people.

Our journey began in 2013 with a vision to redefine India’s place in the global chemical landscape. The early years focused on building foundations — assembling exceptional talent, creating state-of-the-art facilities, and investing deeply in research and development. By 2018, commercial operations were in full swing, and since then, we have sustained a compound annual growth rate of nearly 35%, establishing Aether as one of India’s fastest-growing specialty chemical enterprises.

Our team, the “Aetherians,” is young, dynamic, enthusiastic, and determined. With an average age of just 29 years, we are powered by fresh perspectives and united by a shared commitment to excellence. Together, we have built a company that doesn’t just follow global standards — we set them.

Our business model is anchored on three pillars — Contract Research and Manufacturing Services (CRAMS), Contract and Exclusive Manufacturing (CEM), and Large-Scale Exclusive Manufacturing (LEM). Initially, the pharmaceutical sector was our primary revenue driver. We have since diversified into other high-value sectors such as oil &#x26; gas, material sciences, and specialty performance chemicals. Today, CRAMS is the most significant focus of our business model, reflecting our ability to deliver complex, high-impact projects for growing global clientele.

The in-house R&#x26;D sets us apart. Each chemistry and technology we deploy has been conceived, developed, and perfected by our own research team. From commissioning solar power projects to forging global partnerships in plastic upscaling and bio-based products, we are shaping a future where cutting-edge chemistry works hand in hand with environmental responsibility.

From a small team in 2013 to a recognised global contender in 2025, Aether’s story remains one of resilience, innovation, and a clear vision — to lead, to pioneer, and to keep challenging what’s possible.

Driving Innovation, Scaling Impact

It is my privilege to share my thoughts with you in this Annual Report for FY 2024–25 — a year that has tested our resilience, sharpened our strategic focus, and positioned Aether Industries at the forefront of a rapidly transforming specialty chemicals landscape. The past twelve months have been marked by disciplined execution, capacity expansion, and the deepening of relationships with some of the most respected innovators across the globe. Our CRAMS and exclusive manufacturing business model has grown by 95% this year, reaffirming our belief that it is a robust and future-ready engine for Aether’s growth.

Our commitment to safety, sustainability, and operational excellence remains unwavering. This year, we successfully cleared multiple multi-day HSE audits from global multinational innovators and regulatory authorities. These are not just compliance milestones — they are affirmations of the culture we have built. Our R&#x26;D expenses (revenue plus capital), this year stood at ₹681 million, approximately 8% of total revenues, being the highest in the Indian specialty chemicals sector. This is both a statement of intent and a structural commitment to ensuring that innovation remains embedded in our business model.

At the heart of this progress lies our commitment to research and development. Around the world, chemistry R&#x26;D is entering a new phase — driven by accelerated computational modelling, real-time reaction monitoring, process intensification technologies, and global collaborations that integrate discovery with scale-up from day one. The leading players are moving beyond the traditional linear path of lab-to-plant, adopting concurrent engineering approaches where synthesis optimisation, safety assessment, and manufacturing feasibility are evaluated in parallel. Aether has embraced this global model, blending advanced analytical instrumentation, continuous reaction technology, and data-driven scale-up methods with the intellectual capital of our scientists. This ensures that our R&#x26;D outcomes are not just publishable or patentable, but commercially deployable at world-class efficiency.

I see the coming years as a period of accelerated growth and diversification. Our project pipeline is strong, our sites are expanding, and our partnerships are deepening. The balanced portfolio we envision will allow us to participate in the next wave of global demand while remaining resilient to market cycles. I would like to express my gratitude to our employees, whose dedication and expertise are the foundation of all that we achieve; to our customers, whose trust allows us to be a part of their most strategic programs; and to our investors, whose confidence in Aether empowers us to think long term.

As I reflect on the year gone by, I am reminded of a belief that has guided my journey.

From Molecule to Market

continued to be a strong pillar, contributing 55% of revenues in FY25, and will remain an integral part of our portfolio.

“Growth is not an outcome of circumstance, it is the result of deliberate choices and sustained effort.”

“We do not just follow market trends; we aim to define them.”

On the operational front, several capacity expansions moved forward decisively. Site 4 was fully commercialised and is now running at optimum capacity, with supplies underway for multiple products under our strategic supply agreement with major oil and gas partner Hughes. Site 3++ is being dedicated to a key CEM customer, with production expected to commence by the end of Q4 FY 2025–26. Our greenfield Site 5 in Panoli is progressing on schedule, with the first two production blocks targeted for commissioning by end of calendar year 2025. These investments will meaningfully expand our capabilities and allow us to deepen partnerships in industries beyond agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.

We also made significant strides in sustainability. The commissioning of our 15-megawatt solar power plant (with auto-tracker modules) during the year now totalling to 31-megawatts enables us to meet more than 75% of our electricity requirements from renewable sources, reducing our carbon footprint and delivering annual savings of over ₹120 million, which is significantly higher than the industry average.

“Sustainability is not a choice we make today; it is the legacy we leave for tomorrow.”

A key highlight of FY 2024–25 was the successful pivot towards our Contract Research and Manufacturing Services (CRAMS) and Contract/Exclusive Manufacturing (CEM) business models. In FY25, these two segments together contributed nearly 45% of our revenues, and we are firmly on track towards our medium-term goal of 70% contribution from these high-value business models. Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) continues to be a strong pillar, contributing 55% of revenues in FY25, and will remain an integral part of our portfolio.

As I look back on the financial year 2024–25, I am pleased to share that it has been a year of resilience, steady progress, and strategic transformation for Aether Industries. We navigated a challenging market environment with discipline and focus, while advancing our growth plans with a clear vision for the future.

During the year, overall volumes grew by an impressive 34% compared to the previous year, supported by consistent demand across our portfolios and the addition of new customers, every quarter. Pricing stabilised in the second half of the year, and our efforts to expand into higher-value segments began to show visible results. We welcomed 37 new clients during the year, strengthening our presence across geographies and industries.

“Our journey ahead will be defined by the boldness of our vision and the precision of our execution.”

In closing, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to our customers, shareholders, employees, and partners for their trust and support. Your confidence motivates us to set higher benchmarks and pursue opportunities that will define the next phase of Aether’s journey. Together, we are building a future of growth, leadership, and enduring value creation.

# Consistent Performance, Promising Future

# 5. Capital investment, capacity and strategic initiatives

Over the period from FY2016-17 to FY2024-25 Aether Industries has moved from a small, single-site specialty chemicals manufacturer to a diversified, scale-capable specialty chemicals and CRAMS player — delivering exceptional top-line growth, sustained operating margins, expanding manufacturing footprint and improved absolute profitability. This transition has been driven by capacity commissioning, a broadened product mix (specialty chemicals, contract manufacturing and CRAMS), selective inorganic/organic capacity investment and an IPO that accelerated the Company’s institutional profile and access to capital.

# 1. Revenue growth — scale and compounding expansion

Aether’s revenue has grown very rapidly in absolute terms over the years. The Company reported total revenues in the early commissioning year of FY2016-17 of ₹248.60 million (≈ ₹24.86 crore), reflecting the first commercial streams coming online, and reported total income for FY2024-25 of ₹880.33 crore, representing a transformational increase in scale. When measured on a consistent basis (FY2016-17 → FY2024-25), this implies a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~56% in revenue — a rare rate of compounding that illustrates both strong market demand and the successful execution of capacity ramps and commercial traction.

# 2. Profitability and margins — healthy operating leverage

Aether has historically delivered robust operating margins for a chemicals manufacturer. In FY2018-19 and FY2019-20 the Company reported EBITDA margins in the mid-20% range (the FY2018-19 EBIDTA margin was ~24.4%; FY2019-20 ~24.3%), demonstrating a high-margin product mix early in its growth. In FY2024-25, the business maintained healthy profitability with improved absolute EBITDA and a return to positive full-year PAT after earlier volatility. The FY2024-25 consolidated financials show a notable recovery in PAT and EBITDA as revenues scaled.

# 3. Profitability trajectory (absolute profits)

Absolute PAT has shown volatility historically—early years had modest profits as the company invested to scale, and certain years included non-recurring items and exceptional events. Importantly, FY2024-25 recorded a meaningful recovery in annual total income and reported consolidated profits for the year (and the Q4 FY25 quarter reported net profit and revenue growth quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year). For FY2024-25 total income was ₹880.33 crore and the company reported positive consolidated PAT for the year.

# 4. Segmental performance and business mix

Aether operates principally across three revenue pools:

1. Speciality chemicals (large-scale proprietary intermediates) — primary revenue contributor, benefits from technical know-how and scale.
2. Contract / Exclusive Manufacturing — manufacturing for large pharma/chemical customers on long-term and multi-year relationships.
3. CRAMS (Contract Research &#x26; Manufacturing Services) — higher-value R&#x26;D-linked manufacturing with escalating demand, particularly after the Company’s public listing and focused business development.

The relative weighting shifted over the period in favour of CRAMS and contract manufacturing, increasing recurring revenue visibility and improving absolute EBITDA contribution per rupee of revenue. The Company’s investor materials and presentations emphasise an expanding share of CRAMS in the mix.

“The year gone by has been one of steady recovery, operational discipline, and renewed momentum across our financial and strategic priorities.

This has also helped us bring up positive operating cash flows in the Fiscal Year 2025, which were negative till the last fiscal year. Our approach continues to prioritise capital efficiency, risk management, and a strong balance sheet. With operational headroom, healthy liquidity, and robust governance, we are confident of sustaining growth while creating enduring value for all stakeholders.

We closed the fiscal year with stronger fundamentals — Revenue, EBITDA, Profit After Tax, ROCE, and ROE, all improved over the previous year. All these financial numbers have grown in Fiscal Year 2025 as compared to Fiscal Year 2024 - Revenue by 38.12%, EBITDA by 93.51%, PAT by 92.04%. The ROE and ROCE have grown to 7.12% and 8.50% in Fiscal Year 2025 against 4.00% and 4.70% in Fiscal Year 2023, respectively. This performance reflects a combination of improved capacity utilization, better product mix, and prudent financial management.

Our expansion projects remain firmly on schedule. The planned commissioning timelines for ongoing phases at Site 3++ and Site 5 will strengthen our manufacturing footprint and position us to serve a broader global customer base.

We have also made encouraging progress in new initiatives and collaborations with customers. These partnerships are tracking well and are expected to contribute meaningfully in the coming years.

On the insurance claim related to the November 2023 accident, we had put up a claim of ₹100 crores to the insurance company, which has been accepted by them. Of this, ₹36 crores has already been received, and the balance will be released in phases, with full settlement expected in FY26.

The working capital cycle which has always been critical for us since last few years, we are able to reduce the same to a considerable level in Fiscal Year 2025, with continuing efforts being made to bring it more down to have a better working capital days.

Financial Capital

In FY 2024-25, Aether Industries Limited demonstrated the resilience, prudence, and adaptability of its financial capital in an environment shaped by global market pressures and operational challenges. Despite headwinds such as intensified competition from Chinese players, a slowdown in the agrochemicals sector, and the temporary disruption from the fire at Manufacturing Facility 2, the Company maintained a strong financial foundation and continued to invest strategically in its long-term growth agenda.

# Revenue and Margins

Total revenue for the year stood at ₹8,803 million, with Large Scale Manufacturing, Contract / Exclusive Manufacturing and CRAMS recording modest growth of 29.71%, 71.39% and 24.31% respectively. The major driver being the Contract / Exclusive Manufacturing, which has grown due to the Baker Hughes contract showing a positive outlook for future. EBITDA Margin and PAT Margin growing by 93.51% and 92.05% respectively in Fiscal Year 2025, compared to Fiscal Year 2024.

# Capital Investment

Capital investments during the year were focused on strengthening manufacturing capabilities and enhancing future growth prospects. Supported by the successful Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) in June 2023, we advanced the expansion at Site 3++, initiated the phase one at Site 5, and witnessed the commissioning of Site 4 by Aether Specialty Chemicals Limited in March 2024 — a milestone that expands our capacity and product portfolio.

# Positive Working Capital Management

Our financial stewardship emphasised liquidity preservation, efficient working capital management, and disciplined capital allocation. Debtor days were reduced, while inventory levels temporarily increased due to the restart of Facility 2 and higher in-process stock. These measures ensured operational continuity while supporting future scaling. But overall working capital cycle has been reduced considerable in Fiscal Year 2025 compared to Fiscal Year 2024.

# Support from Investors

Investor confidence, built through consistent performance post-IPO in FY 2022-23 and reinforced by the QIP in June 2023, remained a cornerstone of our financial stability. This trust empowers us to continue investing in innovation, capacity expansion, and market diversification. This trust remains upheld by some marque investors, who believe in our growth story and are there to support us further.

# Looking forward

Looking ahead, Aether will leverage its robust balance sheet and strategic capital deployment to seize emerging opportunities, deepen global partnerships, and deliver sustained value creation. By aligning financial discipline with growth ambition, we are confident of navigating dynamic market conditions and accelerating our journey as a global leader in the specialty chemicals sector.

# Strategic Diversification in Business Segments

Aether has evolved from a business led primarily by pharmaceuticals in past, with agrochemicals as the next largest contributor, to a more diversified portfolio today. While revenues from pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals continue to grow each year, their share in the revenue from operations has transitioned as other sectors such as oil &#x26; gas and material sciences gain momentum. At the same time, sustainability &#x26; renewable segment is emerging as strong pillar of our future growth.

In the last two years, the share of pharmaceuticals in revenue has moved from 50.8% to 45.6% and agrochemicals from 27.2% to 21.2%, even as absolute revenues in both have increased. This shift reflects rapid growth in other sectors like, material sciences rising from 7.9% to 11.4%, oil &#x26; gas from 1.6% to 6.0%, and sustainability &#x26; renewables emerging from nil to 1.05%. This diversification marks a decisive step towards building a balanced and future-ready portfolio. These are a result of new contracts entered into by us with Saudi Aramco, Novoloop, Milliken, Baker Hughes, Seqens and many others.

A Commitment beyond Business

Our vision is not limited to literacy. We support the full ecosystem — from school infrastructure to essential resources that ensure continuity in learning. Alongside this, we contributed to initiatives in healthcare, senior citizen care, animal welfare, and sports — areas that reflect our belief in inclusive and compassionate development.

As I reflect on the year gone by, I do so not merely as a director but as someone entrusted with a responsibility to ensure that Aether’s growth always carries forward its values, its vision, and its deeper purpose. This year has not just been a milestone. It has been a mirror, reflecting what we truly stand for, and a marker, showing where we are heading.

“Our purpose is not tied to markets. It is rooted in meaning.”

Healthcare remained a key focus for us this year, receiving over 12 percent of our total CSR contribution. But beyond numbers, what defines our healthcare efforts is intention. We focused on ensuring access to essential and preventive care for the most vulnerable because no one should be denied well-being due to where they are born or what they can afford. Health is not a privilege. It is a right. And as we move forward, we see healthcare not just as a support pillar, but as a space for meaningful service and real-world change.

Even in times of uncertainty, our purpose has never wavered. We continue to act not because we have to, but because we deeply believe it matters. At Aether, we do not chase legacy. We build it patiently and quietly through decisions that uplift others and actions that outlive us.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to our employees, partners, and all stakeholders who walk this journey with us. Your commitment and belief are the silent strength behind every visible success.

We also supported Sports initiatives that cultivate focus, ambition, and national pride. These contributions, while part of a broader commitment, reflect our recognition of the role sports play in character building and community inspiration.

As we look ahead, we remain rooted in values and committed to action. In 2025–26, we aim to expand our efforts toward environmental stewardship through initiatives that restore balance between growth and the natural world.

Aether’s progress has always been deeply connected to the progress of the communities around us. We have never treated CSR as a checklist. It is a commitment that stems from gratitude. Our social responsibility is not shaped by regulation but by belief that growth, to be meaningful, must be shared.

What binds all our initiatives together is not a budget, but a belief that every act of responsibility carries the power to uplift lives. At Aether, we do not believe in charity. We believe in shared destiny.

“We are proud that our values are not driven by circumstances but guided by conscience.”

If there is one foundation on which our CSR vision firmly rests, it is education. Nearly 80 percent of our CSR contribution this year was dedicated to educational empowerment. We believe that education is not just a tool for betterment, It is the root of transformation. It changes individuals, strengthens families, and ultimately reshapes society. Especially in underserved and tribal areas, education has the power to shift generations forward. At Aether, we do not just support education. We invest in futures with depth, consistency, and care.

Aether’s values are inspired by nature itself, by the five elements that have long guided Indian thought: earth, water, fire, air, and aether. From earth, we learn grounding, the need to stay rooted in purpose. Water teaches us adaptability, flowing to where the need is greatest. Fire gives us intensity, the will to act with clarity. Air teaches movement, the importance of growth with lightness and openness. And aether, the invisible fifth, reminds us of connection, spirit, and the space we must always leave for others to rise.

Business Responsibility &#x26; Sustainability Report(BRSR)

(C) Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.

As a company operating within the chemical sector, we acknowledge the significance of minimizing waste and lessening our environmental footprint. To this end, we've instituted a comprehensive waste recycling initiative aimed at diminishing waste generation and discovering inventive methods for its reuse or recycling. Our program encompasses several key initiatives:

# Leadership indicators

(A) Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing industry) or for its services (for service industry)? SMS, exhibitions gatherings, etc to understand their needs. Currently the Company does not conduct LCA, but have made the decision to conduct Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) for all of our products wherein we will be analysing the environmental impact of our products from their initial creation all the way through their use and eventual disposal.

# Waste Reduction:

We've implemented strategies to curtail waste production through more efficient production methods, reduced raw material usage, and optimized supply chain management. Conducting LCAs offers several advantages. Firstly, it allows us to identify areas where we can reduce our environmental footprint, whether it's through optimizing manufacturing processes, choosing more sustainable materials, or improving end-of-life disposal methods, it also aligns with our vision of being a responsible corporate and creating a positive impact on the environment for future generations.

# Waste Segregation:

Ensuring recyclable materials are separated from non-recyclables maximizes our ability to reuse or recycle waste.

# Recycling Partnerships:

Collaborating with local recycling facilities and specialists allows us to recycle waste effectively, including operating our Solvent Recovery Plant.

# Education and Training:

Providing employees with education and training on waste reduction and recycling fosters awareness and participation in environmental stewardship.

# Innovation:

Investing in research and development enables us to explore novel technologies and processes for repurposing waste materials into new products. Our waste recycling endeavours have not only reduced our environmental impact but also led to new business opportunities and cost savings. Embracing a circular economy model allows us to conserve resources, diminish waste, and deliver value to our customers and stakeholders.

Overall, we view our waste recycling program as integral to our sustainability commitment and responsible business conduct. We remain steadfast in our dedication to discovering fresh, innovative approaches to curbing our environmental impact and building a more sustainable future.

(D) Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) applies to Aether, and the Company adheres to all necessary steps.

Yes, the Company has implemented a comprehensive procedure to address the grievances of its employees.

If the issue remains unresolved, the respective business HR will be the next point of contact, responsible for investigating the matter and providing a resolution based on fair and transparent dealings.

For POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) related matters, the employee is expected to raise the issue with the local HR team or the dedicated email ID for the IC (Internal Complaints) Committee. If necessary, the matter can be escalated to the Chairperson of the IC Committee. The final level of escalation for POSH matters will be to the Head HR of the Organisation. Overall, the Company is committed to ensuring that its employees feel heard and supported in addressing their grievances. This grievance redressal procedure is a critical component of the Company's commitment to creating a positive and respectful workplace culture.

# (D) Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation.

The entity has implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge mechanism. The ZLD plant is designed to treat wastewater and minimize the amount of liquid waste produced. Here is a breakdown of the treatment process. Industrial effluent from the various stages of the process is collected and treated in an Effluent Treatment Plant having primary treatment facility. The effluent is first collected in Collection tank. The effluent is then transferred into Equalization cum Neutralization tank and retained for enough time, where pH of the effluent is raised to 8.5 by addition of lime solution from lime dosing tank. Effluent is then pumped to primary settling tank, where suspended particles are settled. The primary treated effluent is collected into a collection tank. The settled sludge from primary settling tank is dewatered and dried in a Filter Press. The filtrate collected is returned to the neutralization tank for treatment. The dried sludge is sent to the TSDF site for secured land filling. Then the primary treated effluent is going for stripper to remove low volatile organic and bottom material is going for evaporation in MEE/MVR. The condensate from evaporation system is transferred for secondary treatment (SBT Plant).

“Deemed Exports” refer to those transactions in which the goods supplied do not leave the country, and the payment for such supplies is received either in Indian rupees or in free foreign exchange. We have started business in one new country in Fiscal Year 2024, Hungary, which depicts the growth of Company’s business geographically.

# Automation

Our manufacturing facilities utilize DCS that use geographically distributed control loops throughout our facilities to control our systems and processes to increase their safety, cost-effectiveness and reliability. Our Pilot Plant and CRAMS operations use a Siemens PCS7 DCS and our manufacturing facilities use a Yokogawa Centum VP DCS.

# Manufacturing Process

Our facilities have been meticulously designed and developed around a chemistry and technology-centric model, where each product is strategically allocated to a specific production stream. This approach grants us the agility to switch from one product to another seamlessly, without any gestation period and with minimal costs. The flexible design of our plants allows us to operate multiple streams within our intermediate product buildings, thereby mitigating contagion risks and ensuring consistent fulfilment of product demand.

When the reaction is complete, the product is analyzed and subjected to further processing, which includes filtration, continuous/ batch distillations, purification processes to get the required quality product. The product is ultimately tested to ensure it meets the applicable specifications before it is supplied to the customer.

# Research &#x26; Development (R&#x26;D)

The cornerstone of our company lies in our in-house research and development, a key driver of our success and a significant differentiator in achieving leading market positions for select products. Our R&#x26;D laboratories are outfitted with modern synthesis equipment, including fume hoods, lab-scale continuous and flow reactors, and advanced separation tools. These labs are supported by state-of-the-art analytical method development (ADL) and quality control (QC) laboratories, equipped with essential instruments for advanced organic chemistry research, such as Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry, Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry, and High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography, among others.

Our dedicated R&#x26;D facilities and Pilot Plant, located at Manufacturing Facility 1 in Sachin, are at the heart of our operations. Every one of our products has been meticulously developed by our in-house R&#x26;D team, scaled up in our Pilot Plant, and transitioned into production with in-house design and engineering. This independent innovation (without external R&#x26;D support) underscores our research capabilities.

Our core competencies in chemistry include Grignards, organolithium and other organometallic chemistry, hydrogenation, catalysis (homogeneous/ heterogeneous), cross-coupling chemistry, and metathesis/polymerization chemistry. Our technology competencies encompass continuous reaction technology, high-pressure reaction technology, fixed-bed reaction technology, DCS process automation, and high vacuum distillation technology (wiped film/ short path).

As of March 31, 2025, our specialized R&#x26;D team comprised 287 (March 31, 2024: 276) scientists and engineers, including 143 (March 31, 2024: 148) with PhDs or Master's degrees, and 141 (March 31, 2024: 122) chemical engineers. To further enhance our R&#x26;D capabilities, we have recently procured an additional land adjacent to our current R&#x26;D and Pilot Plant Unit, along with the ownership taken of the current land bank of the R&#x26;D and Pilot Plant Unit. The additional land would be utilized for the expansion of the Research &#x26; Development unit, where the number of Fume Hoods will be approximately tripled.

We also maintain strong collaborations with numerous universities and research institutions across India, including the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL, Pune), the Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT, Mumbai), Uka Tarsadia University (UTU, Bardoli), and others.

Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT, Surat). Our sponsored PhD programs, conducted in partnership with these institutions, further strengthen our R&#x26;D capabilities. Our R&#x26;D facilities are recognized by the Department of Scientific &#x26; Industrial Research (DSIR), New Delhi, for in-house R&#x26;D excellence.

In addition, we have expanded our R&#x26;D laboratories by adding more fume hoods, creating four new organic synthesis labs on a separate floor, fully equipped with modern amenities. The architectural and interior design of our R&#x26;D facilities has undergone a complete transformation, evolving into a world-class center featuring a library, scientist lounges, a cafeteria, a coffee house for scientists, modern offices, conference rooms, a gymnasium, and outdoor meeting areas. As part of this expansion, we have recruited additional R&#x26;D scientists and engineers, focusing on those with PhDs or Master’s degrees.

# Upcoming expansions

In March 2024, the Manufacturing Facility 4 has been commissioned and production started in our 100% Wholly Owned Subsidiary - Aether Speciality Chemicals Limited, which will help us save Income Tax by 7% (basic rate). This facility is currently equipped specifically for 6 Products to be manufactured under Contract / Exclusive Manufacturing (C/E M) model for Baker Hughes.

We have also in Fiscal Year 2022, procured plot of land at Panoli GIDC, Bharuch District, Gujarat, which is approximately 1,25,000 plus Sq. Mtrs. and will be utilised for future expansion by the Company. During the Fiscal Year 2024, we have received the regulatory and other approvals for the expansion of this site and first phase work has started. We have in Fiscal Year 2025, procured one more plot of land, adjacent to the Manufacturing Facility 5, making it a 46 acres land all plots of lands put together.

# Pilot Plant

We have a state-of-art Pilot Plant, which is a vital link between R&#x26;D and large scale production. Our Pilot Plant has a dual functionality; it functions to generate critical scale-up data in the transition from R&#x26;D to production to help eliminate issues at full production scale; and it also functions as a stand-alone manufacturing facility for low volume, high value products for our CRAMS customers. Our Pilot Plant encompasses a wide range of reactor and downstream equipment, in both continuous and batch regimes, across the entire range of scale-up volumes, metallurgy, and process parameters and is automated through DCS process automation.

We have tripled our Pilot Plant facility in the Fiscal Year 2023, by increasing the number of reactors. Furthermore, our Pilot Plant has been significantly expanded with the installation of additional pilot-scale equipment. The first phase expansion of the Manufacturing Facility 5 has been started from July 2023, where in the total cost of the first phase is estimated to be ₹500 Crores. The first two production blocks, some common utilities and raw material warehouse is expected to be operational by end of Q3 of Fiscal Year 2025 and then on every six months, we expect, two production blocks to be commissioned.

# Raw Material

The raw materials utilized in our manufacturing processes are predominantly sourced from third-party suppliers both globally and within India. To mitigate the risk of raw material price fluctuations, we typically maintain at least five months of inventory across raw materials, work-in-progress, and recoveries. Specifically, we hold 15 to 30 days of inventory in Work-in-Progress (semi-finished goods), and we maintain minimal inventory of finished goods due to the demand-driven nature of our production process. We usually manufacture finished goods based on orders received, ensuring that they are not held in inventory for more than a week.

In Fiscal Year 2025, our cost of goods sold (which includes the cost of materials consumed and changes in inventories of finished goods and work-in-progress) amounted to ₹4,465.84 MM (Fiscal Year 2024: ₹3,209.17 MM), with the cost of materials consumed representing 60.48% of our revenue from operations (Fiscal Year 2024: 63.09%). Our raw materials encompass crude oil derivatives such as phenol, as well as other essential commodities including hydrogen, ethylene oxide, and isobutylene gas. Key raw materials also include chlorobenzonitrile, methanol, toluene, methylene dichloride, tetrahydrofuran, dichlorotoluene, and thiophene, among others.

We employ a lead-time material requirement planning system and utilize ERP software to manage our inventory levels in real-time. As of March 31, 2024, our inventory in work-in-progress had increased to over 210 days due to the fire accident at Manufacturing Facility 2, which led to its closure for several months. Partial operations resumed in January 2024, and production restarted in February 2024, leading to an increase in work-in-progress as we prioritized manufacturing key products. We have been able to bring down the inventory levels to 173 days as on March 31, 2025, which was 210 days as on March 31, 2024. We further are inclined to manage the same in a more efficient way to reduce the days of inventory more.

# Sales and Marketing

Our business primarily operates on a business-to-business model, with a strong emphasis on maintaining continuous engagement with customers and ensuring timely deliveries. Additionally, we have an exclusive distributor for the Telangana region of India. Our sales, marketing, and business development teams are dedicated to securing new orders, providing...

Moreover, we maintain a commercial general liability insurance policy that safeguards against liabilities arising from bodily injury (including medical payments), property damage, and personal and advertising injury claims. To address specific IT and system-related risks, we have secured a cyber insurance policy. We also offer our employees COVID-19 insurance, covering pre- and post-hospitalization expenses and emergency road ambulance costs. For our Directors and Senior Management, we have a Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance policy, and for our employees, we provide Group Medical Insurance, Group Term Insurance, and Group Personal Accident coverage.

# Competition

The speciality chemicals industry presents significant entry barriers, including customer validation and approvals, expectation from customers for process innovation and cost reduction, high quality standards, and stringent specifications. Our competition varies by market, geographic areas, and type of product. As a result, to remain competitive in our markets, we must continuously strive to reduce our costs of production, transportation, and distribution and improve our operating efficiencies. We face competition primarily from international manufacturers especially Chinese companies. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, technology, cost, delivery and service, as well as quality and depth of senior level relationships.

# Information Technology

Our IT systems are critical to the seamless operation of our business, and we have implemented comprehensive IT policies to support our operations effectively. Our IT team's primary responsibilities include establishing and maintaining enterprise information systems, delivering infrastructure services to meet our business needs, and ensuring the security of our enterprise operations.

In Fiscal Year 2024, we initiated the implementation of SAP S/4HANA, an advanced version of our current SAP-B1 system. We anticipate this new system will go live in the second half of FY26, enhancing our day-to-day operations and facilitating the integration of various departmental workflows.

# Human Resources

We place significant emphasis on the development of our human resources. As of March 31, 2025, our workforce comprised 987 employees (excluding trainees), compared to 954 as of March 31, 2024, along with 224 contract workers and trainees.

Blend of full-time employees and contract personnel allows us the flexibility to operate our business efficiently. During Fiscal Year 2025, our attrition rate was 1.57%. In contrast, our attrition rate in Fiscal Year 2024: 3.97%, primarily influenced by the fire incident at Manufacturing Facility 2, which led to the departure of several employees. The average age of our workforce as of March 31, 2025, was 29 years.

As of the same date, we employed 145 scientists holding either a PhD or Master of Science degree (constituting 14.69% of our workforce). Additionally, we had 141 chemical engineers, representing 14.29% of our workforce, as of March 31, 2023.

Our employees are not affiliated with any unions, and we have not encountered any significant work stoppages due to labor disputes or cessation of work over the past three years.

Our workforce plays a pivotal role in maintaining our standards of quality, productivity, and safety, which in turn bolsters our competitive advantage. The following table provides details of our employee count as of March 31, 2025:

| Departments / Teams                                              | Fiscal Year |

Our goal is to cultivate a culture grounded in fairness and respect, ensuring adherence to our Code of Conduct while safeguarding employees against discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. We are committed to regularly evaluating and enhancing our human resource initiatives to make them more inclusive, engaging, and focused on skill development.

We place a strong emphasis on fostering and maintaining a superior organizational climate centered on human performance. Additionally, we provide our employees with a broad array of training opportunities and have established a comprehensive learning and development policy to support these training initiatives.

Our cost of goods sold, which encompasses the cost of materials consumed and changes in inventories of finished goods and work-in-progress, constitutes a significant portion of our operating expenses. In Fiscal Year 2025, our cost of goods sold amounted to ₹4,465.84 MM (Fiscal Year 2024: ₹3,209.17 MM), representing 53.25% of our revenue from operations (Fiscal Year 2023: 53.65%). We primarily procure raw materials from third-party suppliers, including imports.

These materials include crude oil derivatives, such as phenol, and other key commodities like hydrogen, ethylene oxide, and isobutylene gas. Additional critical raw materials include chlorobenzonitrile, methanol, toluene, methylene dichloride, tetrahydrofuran, dichlorotoluene, and thiophene, among others.

Typically, we do not engage in long-term supply contracts with our raw material suppliers; instead, we source materials through shorter-term contracts or on the open market. The prices of our key raw materials are generally linked to international markets and have exhibited volatility, which can impact our production costs. While fluctuations in crude oil prices may influence our revenues, our profitability tends to be less affected as these price variations are usually passed on to our customers.

In Fiscal Year 2025, our cost of materials as a percentage of revenue from operations reduced very marginally, primarily due to reduced raw material prices.

We have applied for various trademark registrations for our corporate logo under various classes of the Trademark Act, 1999, and Trade Rules, 2002, before the Registrar of Trademarks. The application has been made in the name of the Company. We also have registered the domain names aether.co.in, which is renewable periodically. We also rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright law, and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. We do not own any patents. We have agreements with our employees and consultants which include confidentiality provisions and provisions on ownership of intellectual property developed during employment or specific assignments, as applicable.

Our financial performance and results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including without limitation, global and domestic competition, conditions in the markets of our end-user products, general economic conditions, changes in costs of raw materials, and government regulations and policies.

Management Discussion &#x26; Analysis Report (MD&#x26;AR)

In Fiscal Year 2025, 43.42% of our revenue from operations was derived from exports (excluding Deemed Exports), compared to 41.76% in Fiscal Year 2024. Our net foreign currency-denominated sales (calculated as sales in foreign currency minus expenses related to these sales, excluding Deemed Exports) totalled ₹2,367.19 MM in Fiscal Year 2025, down from ₹2,498.16 MM in the previous fiscal year. Additionally, 9.97% of our raw materials were imported in Fiscal Year 2025, a decrease from 24.57% in Fiscal Year 2024. This reduction is largely due to a strategic buildup of inventory in response to falling international prices and increased availability of raw materials domestically.

Exchange rate fluctuations also impact our ability to meet debt obligations denominated in foreign currencies, such as our Packing Credit Loans in Foreign Currencies. We do not engage in hedging activities to mitigate our foreign currency exposure. Consequently, we are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates among the U.S. Dollar, Indian Rupee, and other currencies. In Fiscal Year 2025, we recorded a gain of ₹38.29 MM from these currency fluctuations, compared to ₹35.45 MM in Fiscal Year 2024.

# Manufacturing Facility

Manufacturing Facility 3 (5,250 square meters) for the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries that use our products as an input. We have other segments, which have shown an upward trend in Fiscal Year 2025, which include increase in the business segments like Material Science from 7.91% in Fiscal Year 2024 to 11.44% in Fiscal Year 2025, Oil &#x26; Gas from 1.56% in Fiscal Year 2024 to 5.98% in Fiscal Year 2025 and Sustainability &#x26; Renewables from 0.00% in Fiscal Year 2024 to 1.05% in Fiscal Year 2025.

Moreover, whatever new products that we are developing in our R&#x26;D Facility are also such products which will be the first of its kind in India and we would be dominating the Indian market with the new products as well.

# Costs of power and fuel

Power and fuel are essential for the uninterrupted operation of our manufacturing facilities. In Fiscal Year 2025, electricity charges represented 2.05% of our revenue from operations (down from 2.26% in Fiscal Year 2024). Overall power and fuel costs, including gas, steam, and diesel, accounted for 2.80% of revenue from operations (a decrease from 4.49% in Fiscal Year 2024).

# Dependence of demand from pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries

As of March 31, 2025, we had over twenty-nine (29) commercial products including twenty (26) pharmaceutical, one (1) coating and two (2) agrochemical intermediates and specialty chemicals. Our products find applications across a number of therapeutic segments in the pharmaceuticals industry, including hypertension, anti-platelet, anti-psychotic, anti-histamine and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (“NSAIDs”).

# Capital expenditure

We require substantial capital for the upkeep and expansion of our facilities. In Fiscal Year 2025, our capital expenditure was ₹4,147.84 MM, compared to ₹3,304.35 MM in Fiscal Year 2024. This expenditure focused on constructing and enhancing manufacturing facilities and diversifying our product range.

# Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Alongside our results prepared in accordance with Ind AS, we believe that the following non-GAAP measures provide valuable insights for assessing our performance and for investor evaluation: EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, PAT Margin, ROE, Capital Employed, ROCE, Debt, Net Debt, Debt-Equity Ratio, Net Debt-EBITDA Ratio, Net Worth, Return on Net Worth, Net Asset Value per Equity Share, Pre-Tax Operating Profit.

# Competition

Our products are used in end-user industries, such as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, amongst other.

# Tangible Assets, Monetary Assets, and the percentage of Monetary Assets to Net Tangible Assets

These non-GAAP metrics are used internally for ongoing operational assessment, planning, and forecasting. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when considered alongside Ind AS-compliant measures, offers additional tools for investors to evaluate our operating results, trends, and for comparative analysis within our industry. They provide consistency and comparability with historical performance. However, our management does not view these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as substitutes for Ind AS financial measures.

# Revenue from operations

The revenue from operations in Fiscal Year 2025 amounted to ₹8,386.90 MM, as against ₹5,981.72 MM, an increase of 40.21% in the comparative periods. The main reasons for the increase in the revenue from operations include:

1. New site - Manufacturing Facility 4 (under our wholly owned subsidiary company - Aether Speciality Chemicals Limited) becomes operational.
2. Reduction in the raw material prices to some extent.
3. Increase in the Contract / Exclusive Manufacturing.

# Change in inventories of finished goods and work-in-progress

Our opening stock of (i) finished goods was ₹493.14 MM as at April 1, 2024, while it was ₹536.19 MM as at April 1, 2023.

# Exceptional items

During the Fiscal Year 2024, there was a fire accident at our Manufacturing Facility 2 in November 2023, which led to some one-time and exceptional expenses, which amount to ₹118.74 MM (Fiscal Year 2024: 137.62 MM). This mainly includes the excess of premium paid for insurance for the insurance claim put up by the Company to the Insurance Company.

# Profit before tax

As a result of the foregoing, we recorded an increase of 94.48% in our profit before tax, which amounted to ₹2,129.84 MM in Fiscal Year 2025, as compared to ₹1,095.12 MM in Fiscal Year 2024.

# Profit for the period

As a result of the foregoing, we recorded an increase of 92.04% in our profit for the year from ₹824.90 MM in Fiscal Year 2024 to ₹1,584.18 MM in Fiscal Year 2025. PAT Margin in Fiscal Year 2025 has been 18%, which was 12.94% in Fiscal Year 2024.

# Liquidity and Capital Resources

# Capital requirement

Our principal capital requirements are for payment for the various capex expansions ongoing at Manufacturing Facility 3++, Manufacturing Facility 4, Manufacturing Facility 1 (for the expansion of the new R&#x26;D) and Manufacturing Facility 5.

Our principal source of funding has been and is expected to continue to be, cash generated from our operations, supplemented by borrowings from banks and financial institutions and optimization of operating working capital. In Fiscal Year 2023, Initial Public Offering (IPO) done in June 2022, has also been a source of funding for the Company. For the Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year 2022, we met our funding requirements, including satisfaction of debt obligations, capital expenditure, investments, other working capital requirements, payouts to shareholders and other cash outlays, principally with funds generated from operations, optimization of operating working capital with the balance met from external borrowings, borrowings from Promoters and a fundraising by way of issuance of equity shares by way of Preferential Allotment of Shares and also Initial Public Offering (IPO).

# Cash flows

Our cash flows from operations had been slightly negative in Fiscal Years 2024 on account of increase in the debtor days and inventory days, mainly on account of various customers delaying the payments especially at quarter ends and releasing the same in the next month along with the inventory increase due, mainly in work-in-progress (semi finished goods) as we had restarted our Manufacturing facility 2 (50%) after the fire accident, in February 2024, wherein various products were in manufacturing and thus the increase.

But in Fiscal Year 2025, we have been able to manage the inventory, debtors and our other working capital elements very well and economically, resulting in a positive operating cash flow of ₹1,000.91 MM positive, which was negative ₹164.58 MM in Fiscal Year 2024.

# Cash flows used in investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities was ₹4,178.86 MM in Fiscal Year 2025, primarily on account of ₹3,043.96 MM used for purchase of fixed assets principally for Manufacturing Facility - 3, Manufacturing Facility 1 (normal capex) and Manufacturing Facility – 2 (normal CAPEX post fire accident in November 2023), Manufacturing Facility 4 (normal Capex) and payment for new Solar Power Plant of 15MW (Auto-Tracker).

Investment in Manufacturing Facility 3++ and Phase One of Manufacturing Facility 5 (at Panoli), which are still in Capital Work in Progress amounting to ₹1,478.98 MM. These were partially offsetting by ₹344.08 due to income from Mutual Fund investments.

Note: All the Contingent Liabilities, except Income Tax Demands, listed above, which are outstanding as on current Balance Sheet date are not 100% secured through cash margins placed with the banks. The Income Tax Demands are under CIT appeal by the Company and the outcome of the same is not known and hence the demand amount has been considered as contingent liability.

# Capital expenditure

Capital expenditures consist primarily of investments in new manufacturing facilities and equipment. We also make investments at our manufacturing facilities to add new technologies, modernise facilities and expand our product lines. Capital expenditure will vary from year to year depending upon a number of factors, including the need to replace equipment and the timing of certain projects, such as investment in new technologies. In the Fiscal Year 2025, we incurred capital damage to the Company’s reputation.

The Company's treasury department within the Finance Department is responsible for liquidity and funding. In addition, policies and procedures relating to such risks are overseen by the management.

# Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company’s reputation.

# Financial risk management

Credit Risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers. The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base, including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate.

Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the Company's historical experience for customers.

The table below sets out an analysis of working capital and current ratio as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024:

# Audit Report - Standalone Financial Statements

To, The Members, Aether Industries Limited Surat

# I. Audit Report on the Financial Statements

# 1. Opinion

# A.

We have audited the accompanying Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements of AETHER INDUSTRIES LIMITED (“the Company”), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date, and a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “Financial Statements”).

# B.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Financial Statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2025, the profit and total comprehensive income, changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.

# 2. Basis of opinion

We conducted our audit of the Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act (SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the independence requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements.

# 3. Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report:

# A. Inventory valuation

The Company manufactures and sells speciality chemicals and intermediates for the pharmaceutical, agrochemicals, oil &#x26; gas, coatings and various other segments, which carry shelf life. As a result, significant level of judgement is involved in estimating inventory valuation. Judgement is required to assess the appropriate net realisable value for short dated raw materials, semi-finished goods and finished goods. Such judgements include management expectations for future sales and inventory liquidation plans.

# B. Assessment of Impairment of Investment made in and Loans given to the subsidiary Company

Management is required to review regularly whether there are any indicators of impairment of such investments / loans by reference to the requirements under Ind AS and perform its impairment assessment by comparing the carrying value of these investments made/ loans given to their recoverable amount to determine whether impairment needs to be recognized. For impairment testing, value in use has to be determined by forecasting and discounting future cash flows of subsidiary. The determination of the recoverable amount from subsidiary company involves management estimates and judgement which may affect the outcome.

# Auditors’ response:

Our audit procedures included, amongst others:

- We attended stock counts to identify whether any inventory was obsolete.
- We assessed the basis for the inventory valuation, the consistency in policy and the rationale in its application.
- We tested the accuracy of the ageing of inventories based on system generated reports.
- We reviewed the testing done for net realizable value of inventories and future plans for consumptions.
- We tested the arithmetical accuracy of valuation files.
- We reviewed product-wise historical data relating to sales return etc. and also its impact on valuation.
- We have assessed the adequacy of disclosure in the Standalone Financial Statements.
- We have tested the reasonableness of key assumptions, including revenue, profit and cash flow growth rates, terminal value and the selection of discount rates management has applied.
- We performed our own independent sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of reasonable changes in management assumptions.
- Independent assessment of the future cash flows and assessing the appropriateness of the future cash flows estimated.
- Assessing the assumptions around the key drivers of the revenue projections, future cash flow, discount rates / weighted average cost of capital that were used by the management.
- Management evaluation of recoverability of loans and granted to its subsidiary company.
- Test the arithmetical accuracy.

# 4. Information other than the Financial Statements

A. The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

B. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements, or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# 5. Management’s responsibilities for the Financial Statements

A. The Company's management is responsible for preparation of these Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act read with relevant rules issued there under. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

# 6. Auditor’s responsibilities for the Financial Statements

A. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards of Auditing issued by the institute of chartered accountants of India, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

B. In preparing the Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

C. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in:

- i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and
- ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Financial Statements.

D. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

E. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all.

F. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

F. With respect to the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements of the Company and the operating effectiveness of such controls, refer to our separate Report in “Annexure A”. Our report expresses an unmodified opinion on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements.

Audit Report - Standalone Financial Statements

Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014 is not modified in respect of this matter. (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, applicable for the financial year ended March 31, 2025.

# IV. Other matters

Based on our examination, which included test checks, the Company has used accounting software for maintaining its books of account for the financial year ended March 31, 2025 which has a feature of recording audit trail (edit log) facility and the same has operated throughout the year for all relevant transactions recorded in the software.

We have checked audit trail feature at every quarter end we did not come across any instances of audit trail feature being tempered. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of AETHER INDUSTRIES LTD. (“The Company”) as of 31 March 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.

# III. Emphasis matter

We draw attention to Note - 35 to the standalone Ind AS financial statements, which describes the effect of fire occurred in factory premises on November 29, 2023. The loss on account of fire are duly considered under exceptional item of profit and loss and account and Note-35. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

# Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting.

# Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting

A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements.

Audit Report - Standalone Financial Statements

for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

# Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Revocation permission for unaffected plants at Site - II were received from GPCB and DISH, which helped the Company revive the Site for last month only.

The Company has, due to this fire accident, suffered loss of Fixed Assets (Plant &#x26; Machinery, Equipment, Furniture &#x26; Fixtures, and others), Inventories (mostly Semi Finished and Finished Goods at the shop floor) and Loss of Profit. The Company is adequately insured to the extent of damage occurred in the fire accident, including impacted property, plant &#x26; equipment, inventories and the loss of profit. The total claim lodged by the Company amounts to ₹1,000 million towards loss of stocks, loss of assets and loss of profit.

The impact of loss is being assessed for the fixed assets and the survey is ongoing by the insurance.

The Company has already received a claim of ₹210 million towards loss of assets, being on account payment on submission of documents of assets lost by fire. The Company has also received a claim of ₹112.46 million towards claim for loss of stocks. The further assessment of claims is in progress and the Company is confident to get the same settled from insurance company in FY 25-26.

This fire accident has not affected our "Going Concern" assumption. Accordingly, the Company will continue as a going concern.

# 2.2 Property, plant and equipment

# Recognition and measurement

The Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of Property, Plant and Equipment ('PPE) recognised as of transition date measured as per the Previous GAAP and use that carrying value as its deemed cost of the PPE as on the transition date. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes purchase price (after deducting trade discount / rebate), non-refundable import duties and taxes, cost of replacing the component parts, borrowing costs and other directly attributable costs to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.

# Asset class

| Asset class                 | Years |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| Computer equipment (others) | 3     |
| Other equipment             | 10    |
| Furniture & fixtures        | 10    |
| Vehicle equipment           | 8     |

# Subsequent costs

The cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is de-recognised. The cost of the day-to-day servicing the property, plant and equipment are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as incurred.

# Disposal

An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon the disposal or when no future benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognised net within other income / expenses in the statement of profit and loss.

# Impairments of non-financial assets

The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that an asset or cash generating unit (CGU) may be impaired. Indefinite life intangibles are subject to a review for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it is necessary. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or CGU's fair value less costs of disposal or its value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

# Depreciation

The depreciable amount of the asset is determined after deducting its residual value. Where the residual value of an asset increases to an amount equal to or greater than the asset's carrying amount, no depreciation charge is recognised till the asset's residual value decreases below the asset's carrying amount. Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, i.e., when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner. Depreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale in accordance with IND AS 105 and the date that the asset is de-recognised.

# Useful life of Tangible Assets

| Asset class                             | Years |
| --------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Factory building                        | 30    |
| Other building                          | 10    |
| Plant and machinery                     | 20    |
| Plant and machinery (Pipelines)         | 15    |
| Office equipment                        | 5     |
| Factory equipment                       | 10    |
| Computer equipment (servers & networks) | 6     |

If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined.

# 2.3 Intangible assets

# Recognition and measurement

Intangible assets are recognised when the asset is identifiable, is within the control of the Company, it is probable that the economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Company and cost of the asset can be reliably measured.

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets acquired by the Company that have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level.

Expenditure on Research activities is recognised in the statement of Profit and Loss as incurred. Development expenditure is capitalised only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Company intends to complete development and to use or sell the asset.

Intangible assets which comprise of the development expenditure incurred on new product and expenditure incurred on acquisition of user licenses for computer software are recorded at their acquisition price.

# Amortization

The useful lives of intangible sets are assessed as either finite of indefinite. Intangible assets i.e., computer software is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of expected future benefits commencing from the date the asset is available for its use.

The management has estimated the useful life of the Intangible Assets as mentioned below:

| Asset class         | Years |
| ------------------- | ----- |
| Software & licenses | 6     |
| Trade marks         | 4     |
| Other assets        | 4     |

Amortisation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each financial year and adjusted if appropriate.

Intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.

Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is de-recognized.

# Disposal

The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.

# 2.4 Financial assets

# A. Fair value assessment

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.

# B. Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement financial assets are classified in three categories:

- Financial assets measured at amortized cost
- Financial assets at fair value through OCI
- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

# C. Financial assets measured at amortised cost

Financial assets are measured at amortized cost if the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. These financial assets are amortized using the effective interest rate ('EIR') method, less impairment. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance income in the Statement of Profit And Loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the Statement of Profit And Loss.

# D. Financial assets at fair value through OCI (‘FVTOCI’)

Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. At initial recognition, an irrevocable election is made (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate investments in equity instruments other than held for trading purpose at FVTOCI. Fair value changes are recognized in the other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the Company recognizes interest income.

Annexure V - Notes forming part of Financial Statements for the year ended at March 31, 2025

# E. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’)

Any financial asset that does not meet the criteria for classification as at amortized cost or as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income is classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Further, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss also include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are fair valued at each reporting date with all the changes recognized in the Statement of Profit And Loss.

# 2.5 Financial liabilities

The Company's financial liabilities include trade payable.

# A. Initial recognition and measurement

All financial liabilities at initial recognition are classified as financial liabilities at amortized cost or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, as appropriate. All financial liabilities classified at amortized cost are recognized initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the fair value at initial recognition is recognized in the Statement of Profit And Loss.

# B. Subsequent measurement

The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends upon the classification as described below:

a. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost

Financial Liabilities that are not held for trading and are not designated as at FVTPL are measured at amortised cost at the end of subsequent accounting periods. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. Interest expense that is not capitalized as part of costs of assets is included as finance costs in the Statement of Profit And Loss.

# C. De-recognition

A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged / cancelled / expired. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the Statement of Profit And Loss.

# D. Offsetting of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

Other incomes, other than interest and dividend are recognized when the same are due to be received and right to receive such other income is established.

# 2.6 Share Capital and Share Premium

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction net of tax from the proceeds. Par value of the equity share is recorded as share capital and the amount received in excess of the par value is classified as share premium.

# 2.7 Dividend distribution to equity shareholders

The Company recognizes a liability to make cash distributions to equity holders when the distribution is authorized and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is authorized when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognized directly in other equity.

# 2.8 Cash flows and cash and cash equivalents

Statement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method prescribed in the relevant IND AS. For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, cheques and drafts on hand, deposits held with Banks, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and book overdrafts. However, Book overdrafts are to be shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the balance sheet for the purpose of presentation.

The Company is banking with the below mentioned Banks for its Working Capital and Banking

# 1. ICICl Bank Ltd.

# 2. HDFC Bank Ltd.

# 2.9 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets

Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable (i.e. more likely than not) that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Such provisions are determined based on management estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a standalone asset only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.

Claim receivable from insurance company, on account of Fire Accident on November 29, 2023 for fixed assets and loss of profit, is still under assessment and hence, the same is not recognised nor contingent asset is created in FY 2023-24.

# 2.10 Revenue recognition and other income

Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government.

Revenue from sale of goods is recognized, when the control is transferred to the buyer, as per the terms of the contracts and no significant uncertainty exists regarding the amount of the consideration that will be derived from the sale of goods.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as finance costs.

Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest rate method. The ‘effective interest rate” is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument to:

- the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or
- the amortised cost of the financial liability.

# 2.11 Leases

At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether:

- the contract involves the use of an identified asset - this may be specified explicitly or implicitly and should be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a substantive substitution right, then the asset is not identified;
- the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use; and
- the Company has the right to direct the use of asset. The Company has this right when it has the decision-making rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used. In rare cases where the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset if either:

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rates as the discount rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

- fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
- variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;
- amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
- the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the.

Annexure V - Notes forming part of Financial Statements for the year ended at March 31, 2025

Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Company is reasonably certain not to terminate early. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is change in the Company's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in statement of profit and loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

Leasehold land is amortised over the period of lease remaining as on the date of purchase.

# 2.12 Income taxes

Income tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. Tax is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

# Current tax

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and the tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the country where the Company operates and generates taxable income. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set it off the recognised amounts and it is intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously.

# Deferred tax

Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet method on temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:

- When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
- Taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
- Temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates, and joint arrangements to the extent that the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

# 2.13 Current versus non-current classification

The Company presents assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet based on current/non-current classification.

# a) An asset is current when it is:

- Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle,
- Held primarily for the purpose of trading,
- Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or
- Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.

All other assets are classified as non-current.

# b) A liability is current when:

- It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle,
- It is held primarily for the purpose of trading,
- It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or
- There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.

All other liabilities are classified as non-current.

# c) Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

# 2.14 Employee benefits

# (i) Short term employee benefits

All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee benefits. Un-discounted value of benefits such as salaries, incentives, allowances and bonus are recognized in the period in which the employee renders the related service.

# (ii) Long term employee benefits

# Defined contribution plans

The Company contributes to the employee's approved provident fund scheme. The Company's contribution paid/payable under the scheme is recognized as an expense in the statement of profit and loss during the period in which the employee renders the related services.

# Defined benefit plans

Gratuity Liability is a defined benefit obligation and is provided on the basis of an actuarial valuation model made at the end of each quarter. The Gratuity Liability is funded by the Company by maintaining the funds with a separate Asset Management Company, i.e., LIC of India. Contributions to such fund is charged to Profit &#x26; Loss Account. Actuarial Valuation of the Gratuity is done at the end of the Financial Year and accounted for accordingly.

# 2.15 Trade receivables

Trade Receivables are stated after writing off debts considered as bad. Adequate provision is made for debts considered as doubtful.

# 2.16 Inventories

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalents. Raw Materials, Work in Progress, Finished Goods, Packing Materials, Stores, Spares and Consumables are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value.

In determining the cost of Raw Materials, Packing Materials, Stores, Spares and Consumables, FIFO Method is used. Cost of Inventory comprises of all costs of purchase, duties, taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable from tax authorities) and all other costs incurred in bringing the inventory to their present location and condition.

Cost of Finished Goods includes the cost of Raw Materials, Packing Materials, an appropriate share of fixed and variable production overheads, indirect taxes as applicable and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.

Cost of Stock in Trade procured for specific projects is assigned by specific identification of individual costs of each item.

# 2.17 Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset, that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, are capitalized as part of the cost of the respective asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs consist of interest, exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the interest cost and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowings of the funds.

# 2.18 Earnings per share

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements and stock split in equity shares issued.

# 2.19 Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.

# 2.20 Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currency of the Company at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.

# 2.21 Government grants and subsidies

Grants/subsidies that compensate the Company for expenses incurred are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as other operating income on a systematic basis in the periods in which such expenses are recognised.

# 2.22 Recent accounting pronouncements

Ministry of Corporate Affairs ("MCA" notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time. There are no such recently issued standards or amendments to the existing standards for which the impact on the Financial Statements is required to be disclosed.

The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced
mainly by the individual characteristics of each
customer. However, management also considers the

factors that may influence the credit risk of its
customer base, including the default risk associated
with the industry and country in which customers
operate.

Credit risk is managed through credit approvals,
establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring
the creditworthiness of customers to which the
Company grants credit terms in the normal course of
business. On account of adoption of Ind AS 109, the
Company uses expected credit loss model to assess
impairment loss or gain. The Company uses a matrix
to compute the expected credit loss allowance for
trade receivables. The provision matrix takes into
account available external and internal credit risk
factors and Company's historical experience for

The options granted on any date shall vest not earlier than 1 (one) year and not later than a maximum of 7 (seven) years from the date of grant of options. The vesting period is minimum 1 (one) year but not later than 15 (fifteen) years from the date of grant of options. Vesting of options would be subject to continued employment with the Company. The exercise period shall be 15 (fifteen) years from the date of vesting of options, subject to exceptional circumstances. The vested options can be exercised by the employee any time within the exercise period, or such other shorter period as may be prescribed by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee from time to time and as set out in the Grant Letter.

Sensitivity analysis indicates the influence of a reasonable change in certain significant assumptions on the outcome of the Present value of obligation and aids in understanding the uncertainty of reported amounts. Sensitivity analysis is done by varying one parameter at a time and studying its impact.

Audit Report - Consolidated Financial Statements

To,

The Members,

Aether Industries Limited

Surat

# I. Audit Report on the Financial Statements

# 1. Opinion

# A.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated annual financial statements of AETHER INDUSTRIES LIMITED (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding Company”) and its subsidiary (Holding Company and its subsidiary together referred to as “the Group”), for the year ended 31 March 2025 attached herewith, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Discloser Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended from time (“Listing Regulations”).

# 2. Basis of Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”). Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Annual Financial Results section of our report. We are independent of the Group, in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the independence requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated annual financial statements.

# 3. Information Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report thereon

The Holding Company’s management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Holding Company’s annual report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon.

# 4. Managements’ and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements

The Holding Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated annual financial statements that give a true and fair view of the net profit/loss and other comprehensive income and other financial information of the Group in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated annual financial results that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

# 5. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements

# A.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated annual financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated annual financial results.

# B.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated annual financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement...

Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
4. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated annual financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

# Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of AETHER INDUSTRIES LTD. (“The Company”) as of 31 March 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

# Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

# Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We have conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing.

# Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

# Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting

A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes.

# Opinion

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31 March 2025, based on the

1. Reporting entity

Aether Industries Ltd (Aether) was incorporated on January 23, 2013 as a Public Limited Company under the Companies Act, 1956 (as amended in 2013). It is engaged in the business of Specialty Chemicals and Intermediates. The products of the Company find application in various sectors like Pharmaceuticals, Agrochemicals, Specialty, Electronic Chemicals, Material Sciences, High Performance Photography etc. The CIN of the Company is L24100GJ2013PLC073434.

The Company in January 2023, launched its Site 3 at Plot No. 8202/1, Road No. 8, GIDC Industrial Estate, Sachin, Surat -394230 and launched 5 new products there. Further, the Company also incorporated its 100% Wholly Owned Subsidiary in September 2022, which was named as Aether Speciality Chemicals Limited, with an aim to get more and new products in this subsidiary and save income tax (Income Tax section 115BAB) by starting the production by or before March 31, 2025. The operations started in March 2024 for Aether Speciality Chemicals Limited, at Plot No. 362/363, GIDC Industrial Estate, Sachin Surat - 394230.

Between the year 2013 and early year 2015, the Promoters acquired a leased premise at GIDC Industrial Estate, Hojiwala, Sachin, Surat and established their Laboratory, Research &#x26; Development and Pilot Plant facilities. The Promoters realized at the conceptual stage itself that Specialty Chemicals is essentially a “Research &#x26; Knowledge” driven Industry, and identification of the ‘Chemistries’ and ‘Technologies’ before constructing the main plant, through Laboratory/R&#x26;D/Pilot facilities was a necessary pre-requisite. The period up to 2015 was hence utilized for installing Lab/R&#x26;D/Pilot Plants, developing several products/processes (up to Pilot stage), showcasing the Company’s capabilities through various International Exhibitions/Conferences etc., effecting trial samples/supplies, facing rigorous audits from prospective International Buyers etc.

The Company was able to carry on with the success with which they started of with the first Project which was ready by November 2016, by way of achieving total revenues of ₹248.60 million in FY 2016-17. The Company has, since then seen an upward trend in revenues, which has resulted in increased margins year on year. The Company, because of its continuous growth and increasing demands for the products, along with the necessity to launch new products for various applications, has once again planned for yet another expansion. For the said new expansion, the Company has procured Plot of Land in GIDC Industrial Estate, Panoli admeasuring 1,26,200 Sq. Mtrs. and the same is located just 55 Kms or 1 hour drive from the current locations in GIDC, Sachin. The Company has further procured an adjacent land, admeasuring 60,000 Sq. Mtrs. This makes the Site 5 a huge site admeasuring 46 acres in total and the same would be used by the company for its current and future expansions. The first phase of expansion at this site is already under progress and expected to be operational from Q4 of FY26.

After meeting with a fair degree of success and acceptance from the targeted buyers, the Company acquired about 10500 Sq. Mtrs. of land at the GIDC Industrial Estate, Sachin, Surat in February 2015 for setting up its main plant. The plant stood commissioned as per schedule, and the first stream went into operations in October 2016 / November 2016.

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025 prepared their realization into cash and cash equivalents, the outstanding.. Based on the above factors, the management has concluded that the "going concern" assumption is appropriate. Accordingly, the Financial Statements do not include any adjustments regarding the recoverability and classification of the carrying amount of assets and classification of liabilities that might result, should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The Board of Directors approved the Financial Statements as per the Ind AS, for the year ended on March 31, 2025 along with Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 and authorised to issue the same vide resolution passed in the Board Meeting held on May 2, 2025.

# B. Basis of measurement

The Financial Statements have been prepared on historical cost basis considering the applicable provisions of Companies Act 2013. The exceptions to the same are:

- certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) that are measured at fair value; and
- net defined benefit (asset) / liability that are measured at fair value of plan assets less present value of defined benefit obligations.

# C. Current and non-current classification of assets and liabilities

The Assets and Liabilities and the Statement of Profit &#x26; Loss, including related notes, are prepared and presented as per the requirements of Schedule III (Division II) to the Companies Act, 2013. All assets and liabilities have been classified and disclosed as current or non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in Schedule III.

# D. Functional and presentation currency

The functional and presentation currency in these Financial Statements is ₹ and all amounts are rounded to nearest millions, up to 2 decimal places, unless otherwise stated.

# E. Use of judgements, estimates and assumptions

The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities, non-current liabilities and the disclosure of the contingent liabilities on the date of the preparation of Financial Statements. Such estimates are on a reasonable and prudent basis considering all available information, however due to uncertainties about these judgements, estimates and assumptions, the actual results could differ from those estimates. Information about each of these estimates and judgements is included in relevant notes.

# Going concern assumption

These Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The management has, given the significant uncertainties arising out of the various situations, assessed the cash flow projections and available liquidity for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this Financial Statements. Based on this evaluation, management believes that the Company will be able to continue as a "going concern" in the foreseeable future and for a period of at least twelve months from the date of these Financial Statements.

On November 29, 2023, an accidental fire broke out at our Manufacturing Facility – II which is situated at Plot No. 8203, Road No. 8, GIDC Industrial Estate, Sachin, Surat - 394230, Gujarat (India). This fire accident has adversely impacted the Site II, mainly damaging Plant 2 (fully), Plant 1 and Tank Farm (partially). This Site - II had been contributing the major share to revenue from operations and hence, the fire accident has hampered the revenues of the Company in FY 2023-24, as the entire Site -II was closed for at least three months. Revocation permission for unaffected plants at Site - II were received from GPCB and DISH, which helped the Company revive the Site for last month only.

The Company has, due to this fire accident, suffered loss of Fixed Assets (Plant &#x26; Machinery, Equipment, Furniture &#x26; Fixtures, and others), Inventories (mostly Semi Finished and Finished Goods at the shop floor) and Loss of Profit. The Company is adequately insured to the extent of damage occurred in the fire accident, including impacted property, plant &#x26; equipment, inventories and the loss of profit. The total claim lodged by the Company amounts to ₹1,000 million towards loss of stocks, loss of assets and loss of profit.

The impact of loss is being assessed for the fixed assets and the survey is ongoing by the insurance surveyor, hence the loss is yet to be ascertained.

The Company has already received a claim of ₹210 million towards loss of assets, being on account payment on submission of documents of assets lost by fire. The Company has also received a claim of ₹112.46 million towards claim for loss of stocks. The further assessment of claims is in progress and the Company is confident to get the same settled from insurance company in FY 25-26.

This fire accident has not affected our "Going Concern" assumption. Accordingly, the Company will continue as a going concern.

# Reclassification

The company reclassifies comparative amounts, unless impracticable and whenever the company changes the presentation or classification of items in its financial statements materially. No such material reclassification has been made during the year.

# 2.2 Property, plant and equipment

# Recognition and measurement

The Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of Property, Plant and Equipment (‘PPE’) recognised as of transition date measured as per the Previous GAAP and use that carrying value as its deemed cost of the PPE as on the transition date.

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes purchase price (after deducting trade discount / rebate), non-refundable import duties and taxes, cost of replacing the component parts, borrowing costs and other directly attributable cost to bringing the asset to the location.

# Depreciation

The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value. Where the residual value of an asset increases to an amount equal to or greater than the asset’s carrying amount, no depreciation charge is recognised till the asset’s residual value decreases below the asset’s carrying amount. Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, i.e., when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner. Depreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale in accordance with IND AS 105 and the date that the asset is derecognised.

# Subsequent costs

The cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.

# Disposal

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon the disposal or when no future benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss.

# Impairments of non-financial assets

The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that an asset or cash generating unit (CGU) may be impaired. Indefinite life intangibles are subject to a review for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it is necessary. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or CGU's fair value less costs of disposal or its value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

# Useful life of Tangible Assets

| Asset class                             | Years |
| --------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Factory building                        | 30    |
| Other building                          | 10    |
| Plant and machinery                     | 20    |
| Plant and machinery (Pipelines)         | 15    |
| Office equipment                        | 5     |
| Factory equipment                       | 10    |
| Computer equipment (servers & networks) | 6     |
| Computer equipment (others)             | 3     |

If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment had been recognised.

Annexure V - Notes forming part of Financial Statements for the year ended at March 31, 2025

# 2.3 Intangible assets

# Recognition and measurement

Intangible assets are recognised when the asset is identifiable, is within the control of the Company, it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Company and cost of the asset can be reliably measured.

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets acquired by the Company that have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level.

Expenditure on Research activities is recognised in the statement of Profit and Loss as incurred. Development expenditure is capitalised only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Company intends to complete development and to use or sell the asset.

# Amortization

The management has estimated the useful life of the Intangible Assets as mentioned below:

| Asset class         | Years |
| ------------------- | ----- |
| Software & licenses | 6     |
| Trade marks         | 4     |
| Other assets        | 4     |

Amortisation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each financial year and adjusted if appropriate.

# Disposal

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognized.

# 2.4 Financial assets

# A. Fair value assessment

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.

# B. Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement financial assets are classified in three categories:

- Financial assets measured at amortized cost
- Financial assets at fair value through OCI
- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets are measured at amortized cost if the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. These financial assets are amortized using the effective interest rate (‘EIR’) method, less impairment. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance income in the Statement of Profit And Loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the Statement of Profit And Loss.

# D. Financial assets at fair value through OCI (‘FVTOCI’)

Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. At initial recognition, an irrevocable election is made (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate investments in equity instruments other than held for trading purpose at FVTOCI. Fair value changes are recognized in the other comprehensive income (‘OCI’). However, the Company recognizes interest income, impairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the Statement of Profit And Loss. On derecognition of the financial asset other than equity instruments designated as FVTOCI, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Annexure V - Notes forming part of Financial Statements for the year ended at March 31, 2025

# E. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’)

Any financial asset that does not meet the criteria for classification as at amortized cost or as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income is classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Further, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss also include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are fair valued at each reporting date with all the changes recognized in the Statement of Profit And Loss.

# F. Derecognition

The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the financial asset, the Company recognizes its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.

# 2.5 Financial liabilities

The Company’s financial liabilities include trade payable.

# A. Initial recognition and measurement

All financial liabilities at initial recognition are classified as financial liabilities at amortized cost or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, as appropriate. All financial liabilities classified at amortized cost are recognized initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the fair value at initial recognition is recognised in the Statement of Profit And Loss.

# B. Subsequent measurement

The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends upon the classification as described below:

a. Financial Liabilities classified as Amortised Cost: Financial Liabilities that are not held for trading and are not designated as at FVTPL are measured at amortised cost at the end of subsequent accounting periods. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. Interest expense that is not capitalized as part of costs of assets is included as Finance costs in the Statement of Profit And Loss.

b. Financial Liabilities classified as Fair value through profit And loss (FVTPL):

# C. Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged / cancelled / expired. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the de recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the Statement of Profit And Loss.

# D. Offsetting of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

# G. Impairment of Financial Assets

The Company assesses impairment based on expected credit loss (‘ECL’) model on the following:

- Financial assets that are measured at amortised cost; and
- Financial assets measured at FVTOCI

ECL is measured through a loss allowance on a following basis:

- The 12 month expected credit losses (expected credit costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction net of tax from the proceeds.

# 2.6 Share Capital and Share Premium

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction net of tax from the proceeds. Par value of the equity share is recorded as share capital and the amount received in excess of the par value is classified as share premium.

# 2.7 Dividend Distribution to equity shareholders

The Company recognizes a liability to make cash distributions to equity holders when the distribution is authorized and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is authorized when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognized directly in other equity.

# 2.8 Cash Flows and Cash and Cash Equivalents

Statement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method prescribed in the relevant IND AS. For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, cheques and drafts on hand, deposits held with Banks, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and book overdrafts. However, Book overdrafts are to be shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the balance sheet for the purpose of presentation.

The Company is banking with the below mentioned Banks for its Working Capital and Banking requirements:

1. ICICI Bank Ltd.
2. HDFC Bank Ltd.

# 2.9 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets

Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event.

and it is probable (i.e. more likely than not) that an asset is created in FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25. the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the using the straight-line method from the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Such provisions are determined based on management estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a Consolidated asset only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.

# 2.10 Revenue Recognition and Other Income

Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance costs.

Revenue from sale of goods is recognized, when the control is transferred to the buyer, as per the terms of the contracts and no significant uncertainty exists regarding the amount of the consideration that will be derived from the sale of goods.

Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest rate method. The "effective interest rate" is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument to:

- the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or
- the amortised cost of the financial liability.

Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered to exist when a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from it. Contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of judgment of management/independent experts. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current management estimate.

# 2.11 Leases

At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether:

- the contract involves the use of an identified asset - this may be specified explicitly or implicitly and should be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use; and
- the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company has this right when it has the decision-making rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rates as the discount rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

- fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
- variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;
- amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
- the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Company is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is change in the...

Company's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in statement of profit and loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

Leasehold land is amortised over the period of lease remaining as on the date of purchase.

# Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

The Company has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liability for the short-term leases that have lease term of 12 months of less and leases of low-value assets. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with such leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# 2.12 Income taxes

Income tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. Tax is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

# Current tax

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and the tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the country where the Company operates and generates taxable income.

# 2.13 Current verses non-current classification

# Rationale for principal variables used

• Time to maturity of options is the period of time from the grant date to the date on which option is expected to be exercised. The minimum life of stock option is the minimum period before which the options cannot be exercised, and maximum life is the period after which the options cannot be exercised.

• The expected price volatility is based on the historic volatility, adjusted for any changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.

The company has recorded employee share-based compensation expense in the current year amounting to ₹33.27 million (Previous year: ₹36.76 million) for the options granted to the employees.
