    "From Molecule to Market\n\"Growth is not an outcome of circumstance, it is the result of deliberate choices and sustained effort.\"\nAs I look back on the financial year 2024-25, I am pleased to share that it has been a year of resilience, steady progress, and strategic transformation for Aether Industries. We navigated a challenging market environment with discipline and focus, while advancing our growth plans with a clear vision for the future.\nDuring the year, overall volumes grew by an impressive 34% compared to the previous year, supported by consistent demand across our portfolios and the addition of new customers, every quarter. Pricing stabilised in the second half of the year, and our efforts to expand into higher-value segments began to show visible results. We welcomed 37 new clients during the year, strengthening our presence across geographies and industries.\nA key highlight of FY 2024-25 was the successful pivot towards our Contract Research and Manufacturing Services (CRAMS) and Contract/ Exclusive Manufacturing (CEM) business models. In FY25, these two segments together contributed nearly 45% of our revenues, and we are firmly on track towards our medium-term goal of 70% contribution from these high-value businesses models. Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) From Molecule to Market\ncontinued to be a strong pillar, contributing 65% of revenues in FY25, and will remain an integral part of our portfolio.\nAs we close this year, we do so with a stronger client base, a broader set of capabilities, and a sharper focus on high-value business models. The path ahead will be defined by the boldness of our vision and the precision of our execution.\nIn closing, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to our customers, shareholders, employees, and partners for their trust and support. Your confidence motivates us to set higher benchmarks and pursue opportunities that will define the next phase of Aether's journey. Together, we are building a future of growth, leadership, and enduring value creation.\nRohan Desai\nCo-founder | Director (Commercial)"
