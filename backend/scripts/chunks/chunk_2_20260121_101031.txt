    "Driving Innovation, Scaling Impact\nIt is my privilege to share my thoughts with you in this Annual Report for FY 2024–25 — a year that has tested our resilience, sharpened our strategic focus, and positioned Aether Industries at the forefront of a rapidly transforming specialty chemicals landscape. The past twelve months have been marked by disciplined execution, capacity expansion, and the deepening of relationships with some of the most respected innovators across the globe. Our CRAMS and exclusive manufacturing business model has grown by 95% this year, reaffirming our belief that it is a robust and future-ready engine for Aether’s growth.\n\nAt the heart of this progress lies our commitment to research and development. Around the world, chemistry R&D is entering a new phase — driven by accelerated computational modelling, real-time reaction monitoring, process intensification technologies, and global collaborations that integrate discovery with scale-up from day one. The leading players are moving beyond the traditional linear path of lab-to-plant, adopting concurrent engineering approaches where synthesis optimisation, safety assessment, and manufacturing feasibility are evaluated in parallel. Aether has embraced this global model, blending advanced analytical instrumentation, continuous reaction technology, and data-driven scale-up methods with the intellectual capital of our scientists. This ensures that our R&D outcomes are not just publishable or patentable, but commercially deployable at world-class efficiency. In many ways, our approach reflects the same mindset as global leaders in specialty chemicals research — but adapted to India’s speed, cost-competitiveness, and engineering ingenuity.\n\nThis global-aligned approach is reinforced by our expanding infrastructure. Site-1, our R&D and pilot-scale innovation hub, is undergoing a major expansion that will double its capacity, a reflection of our continued confidence in the strength of our innovation pipeline. With eight dedicated research groups and 63 hoods, Site-1 is not only the heart of our new ventures but also a unique innovation centre in the Indian\n\nDriving Innovation, Scaling Impact\n\n\nDr. Aman Desai\nCo-Founder | Director (Research & Operations)\n\nInnovation is not an isolated event in a laboratory — it is a living process that connects the first molecule to the final market\n\nOur relationships with global innovators have not only deepened but also diversified. Strategic partnerships with Baker Hughes, SEQENS Group, Saudi Aramco Technologies, Novoloop, and others in sustainability, energy, and advanced materials stand as firm validation that our capabilities — from R&D to scale-up to commercial manufacturing — are validated across the industry spectrum.\n\nDiversification is not about doing many things — it is about doing the right things across many domains.\n\nOur commitment to safety, sustainability, and operational excellence remains unwavering. This year, we successfully cleared multiple multi-day HSE audits from global multinational innovators and regulatory authorities. These are not just compliance milestones — they are affirmations of the culture we have built. Our R&D expenses (revenue plus capital), this year stood at ₹681 million, approximately 8% of total revenues, being the highest in the Indian specialty chemicals sector. This is both a statement of intent and a structural commitment to ensuring that innovation remains embedded in our business model.\n\nI see the coming years as a period of accelerated growth and diversification. Our project pipeline is strong, our sites are expanding, and our partnerships are deepening. The balanced portfolio we envision will allow us to participate in the next wave of global demand while remaining resilient to market cycles. I would like to express my gratitude to our employees, whose dedication and expertise are the foundation of all that we achieve; to our customers, whose trust allows us to be a part of their most strategic programs; and to our investors, whose confidence in Aether empowers us to think long term. As I reflect on the year gone by, I am reminded of a belief that has guided my journey.\n\nDr. Aman Desai\nCo-Founder | Director (Research & Operations)\n\nInnovation is not an isolated event in a laboratory — it is a living process that connects the first molecule to the final market\n\nSites 2 and 3, traditionally our large-scale manufacturing centres, with a strong position in Chinese import substitution, have now fully stabilised post the disruptions of 2023 and are operating at optimum capacity with stabilising pricing trends. Site-3++ represents a strategic milestone, now entirely dedicated to an contract / exclusive manufacturing for a leading global material science company — a project nurtured over four years from laboratory development to full-scale commercial production. Site-4 has moved from preparation to production with the first commercial product launches for major oil and gas partner, turning strategic intent into operational reality with an order pipeline that continues to grow month after month. Site-5 at Panoli, our largest greenfield site, is advancing rapidly with visibility on the first three to four plants, including both large-scale manufacturing and exclusive contract manufacturing projects for European and American partners. We have also procured an adjacent land to our Site-5, ad‑measuring 60,000 square meters, which now makes the Site 5 a 46 acres land, which will be utilised for future expansions.\n\nEvery site we commission is not just an addition to capacity — it is an expansion of possibilities."
