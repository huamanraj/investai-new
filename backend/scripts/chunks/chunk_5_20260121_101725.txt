    "Financial Capital\n\nIn FY 2024-25, Aether Industries Limited demonstrated the resilience, prudence, and adaptability of its financial capital in an environment shaped by global market pressures and operational challenges. Despite headwinds such as intensified competition from Chinese players, a slowdown in the agrochemicals sector, and the temporary disruption from the fire at Manufacturing Facility 2, the Company maintained a strong financial foundation and continued to invest strategically in its long-term growth agenda.\n\nRevenue and Margins\nTotal revenue for the year stood at ₹8,803 million, with Large Scale Manufacturing, Contract / Exclusive Manufacturing and CRAMS recording modest growth of 29.71%, 71.39% and 24.31% respectively. The major driver being the Contract / Exclusive Manufacturing, which has grown due to the Baker Hughes contract showing a positive outlook for future. EBITDA Margin and PAT Margin growing by 93.51% and 92.05% respectively in Fiscal Year 2025, compared to Fiscal Year 2024.\n\nCapital Investment\nCapital investments during the year were focused on strengthening manufacturing capabilities and enhancing future growth prospects. Supported by the successful Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) in June 2023, we advanced the expansion at Site 3++, initiated the phase one at Site 5, and witnessed the commissioning of Site 4 by Aether Specialty Chemicals Limited in March 2024 — a milestone that expands our capacity and product portfolio.\n\nPositive Working Capital Management\nOur financial stewardship emphasised liquidity preservation, efficient working capital management, and disciplined capital allocation. Debtor days were reduced, while inventory levels temporarily increased due to the restart of Facility 2 and higher in-process stock. These measures ensured operational continuity while supporting future scaling. But overall working capital cycle has been reduced considerable in Fiscal Year 2025 compared to Fiscal Year 2024.\n\nSupport from Investors\nInvestor confidence, built through consistent performance post-IPO in FY 2022-23 and reinforced by the QIP in June 2023, remained a cornerstone of our financial stability. This trust empowers us to continue investing in innovation, capacity expansion, and market diversification. This trust remains upheld by some marque investors, who believe in our growth story and are there to support us further.\n\nLooking forward\nLooking ahead, Aether will leverage its robust balance sheet and strategic capital deployment to seize emerging opportunities, deepen global partnerships, and deliver sustained value creation. By aligning financial discipline with growth ambition, we are confident of navigating dynamic market conditions and accelerating our journey as a global leader in the specialty chemicals sector.\n\nRevenue FY25\n+ 38% Y/Y\nEBITDA FY25\n+ 94% Y/Y\nPAT FY25\n+ 92% Y/Y\n\n39 Financial Capital ₹ in MM",
